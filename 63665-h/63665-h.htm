<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Who</span> that has read the “Last Days of Pompeii”
can forget Nydia, the blind flower-girl? So sweet,
and pure, and gentle, and devoted in her unrequited
love, she steals insensibly upon the heart, and wins
a place therein, which even the brilliant Ione fails
to obtain! Poor, artless innocent, her life, alas!
was one of disappointment from its birth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot better portray the character of this
guileless being than by copying the exquisite description
of Bulwer. The scene opens with a
company of gay, young Pompeiians—among whom
is Glaucus, the hero of the story—taking a morning
stroll through the town. We let the story speak
for itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus conversing, their steps were arrested by a
crowd gathered round an open space where three
streets met; and just where the porticoes of a light
and graceful temple threw their shade, there stood
a young girl, with a flower-basket on her right arm,
and a small three-stringed instrument of music in
the left hand, to whose low and soft tones she was
modulating a wild and half-barbaric air. At every
pause in the music she gracefully waved her flower
basket round, inviting the loiterers to buy; and
many a sesterce was showered into the basket,
either in compliment to the music, or in compassion
to the songstress—for she was blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It is my poor Thessalian,’ said Glaucus, stopping;
‘I have not seen her since my return to
Pompeii. Hush! her voice is sweet; let us listen.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I must have yon bunch of violets, sweet
Nydia,’ said Glaucus, pressing through the crowd,
and dropping a handful of small coins into the
basket; ‘your voice is more charming than ever.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blind girl started forward as she heard the
Athenian’s voice—then as suddenly paused, while
the blood rushed violently over neck, cheek, and
temples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So you are returned!’ said she in a low voice;
and then repeated, half to herself, ‘Glaucus is returned!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes, child, I have not been at Pompeii above
a few days. My garden wants your care as before,
you will visit it, I trust, to-morrow. And mind, no
garlands at my house shall be woven by any hands
but those of the pretty Nydia.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nydia smiled joyously, but did not answer; and
Glaucus, placing the violets he had selected in his
breast, turned gayly and carelessly from the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So, she is a sort of client of yours, this child?’
said Clodius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ay—does she not sing prettily? She interests
me, the poor slave!—besides, she is from the land
of the Gods’ hill—Olympus frowned upon her
cradle—she is of Thessaly.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How exquisitely is the love of Nydia told in her
joy at the return of Glaucus! Only a master-hand
could have described it in that blush, and start, and
the glad exclamation, “Glaucus is returned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The revellers meanwhile pass on their way,
and it is not till the following morning that the
flower-girl appears again upon the scene. But
though she comes even while the Athenian is
musing on his mistress Ione, there is a beauty
around Nydia’s every movement which makes us
hail her with delight. It is her appearance at this
visit which the artist has transferred to the canvass.
Lo! are not the limner and the author equally inimitable?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Longer, perhaps, had been the enamored soliloquy
of Glaucus, but at that moment a shadow
darkened the threshold of the chamber, and a
young female, still half a child in years, broke upon
his solitude. She was dressed simply in a white
tunic, which reached from the neck to the ankles;
under her arm she bore a basket of flowers, and in
the other hand she held a bronze water vase; her
features were more formed than exactly became her
years, yet they were soft and feminine in their outline,
and without being beautiful in themselves they
were almost made so by their beauty of expression;
there was something ineffably gentle, and you would
say patient, in her aspect—a look of resigned sorrow,
of tranquil endurance, had banished the smile,
but not the sweetness, from her lips; something
timid and cautious in her step—something wandering
in her eyes, led you to suspect the affliction
which she had suffered from her birth—she was
blind; but in the orbs themselves there was no
visible defect, their melancholy and subdued light
was clear, cloudless, and serene. ‘They tell me
that Glaucus is here,’ said she; ‘may I come
in?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ah, my Nydia,’ said the Greek, ‘is that you?
I knew you would not neglect my invitation.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Glaucus did but justice to himself,’ answered
Nydia, with a blush, ‘for he has always been kind
to the poor blind girl.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who could be otherwise?’ said Glaucus, tenderly,
and in the voice of a compassionate brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nydia sighed and paused before she resumed,
without replying to his remark. ‘You have but
lately returned? This is the sixth sun that hath
shone upon me at Pompeii. And you are well?
Ah, I need not ask—for who that sees the earth
which they tell me is so beautiful can be ill?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am well—and you, Nydia?—how you have
grown! next year you will be thinking of what
answer we shall make your lovers.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A second blush passed over the cheek of Nydia,
but this time she frowned as she blushed. ‘I have
brought you some flowers,’ said she, without replying
to a remark she seemed to resent, and feeling
about the room till she found the table that stood
by Glaucus, she laid the basket upon it: ‘they are
poor, but they are fresh gathered.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They might come from Flora herself,’ said he,
kindly; ‘and I renew again my vow to the Graces
that I will wear no other garlands while thy hands
can weave me such as these.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And how find you the flowers in your viridarium?
are they thriving?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Wonderfully so—the Lares themselves must
have tended them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ah, now you give me pleasure; for I came, as
often as I could steal the leisure, to water and tend
them in your absence.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How shall I thank thee, fair Nydia?’ said the
Greek. ‘Glaucus little dreamed that he left one
memory so watchful over his favorites at Pompeii.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hand of the child trembled, and her breast
heaved beneath her tunic. She turned around in
embarrassment. ‘The sun is hot for the poor
flowers,’ said she, ‘to-day, and they will miss me,
for I have been ill lately, and it is nine days since I
visited them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ill, Nydia! yet your cheek has more color than
it had last year.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am often ailing,’ said the blind girl, touchingly,
‘and as I grow up I grieve more that I am blind.
But now to the flowers!’ So saying, she made a
slight reverence with her head, and passing into the
viridarium, busied herself with watering the flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Poor Nydia,’ thought Glaucus, gazing on her,
‘thine is a hard doom. Thou seest not the earth—nor
the sun—nor the ocean—nor the stars—above
all, thou canst not behold Ione.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nydia, too, is a slave, and to a coarse inn-keeper,
who would make a profit by her beauty and her
singing. How her heart breaks daily at the brutal
treatment of her master, and the still more cruel
language of his patrons! But at length Glaucus
purchases her, and she is comparatively happy.
And through all her melancholy history how does
her hopeless love shine out, beautifying and making
more sweet than ever, her guileless character! It
is a long and mournful tale. Glaucus at length
succeeds in winning Ione; they escape fortunately
from the destruction of Pompeii; but Nydia, uncomplaining,
yet broken-hearted, disappears mysteriously
from the deck of their vessel at night.
Need we tell her probable fate?</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>FORT MOULTRIE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>How</span> often has the story of the heart been told!
The history of the love of one bosom is that of the
millions who have alternated between hope and fear
since first the human heart began to throb. The
gradual awakening of our affection; the first consciousness
we have of our own feelings; the tumultuous
emotions of doubt and certainty we experience,
and the wild rapture of the moment, when, for the
first time, we learn that our love is requited, have
all been told by pens more graphic than mine, and
in language as nervous as that of Fielding, or as
moving as that of Richardson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The daily companionship into which I was now
thrown with Beatrice was, of all things, the most
dangerous to my peace. From the first moment
when I beheld her she had occupied a place in my
thoughts; and the footing of acquaintanceship, not
to say intimacy, on which we now lived, was little
calculated to banish her from my mind. Oh! how
I loved to linger by her side during the moonlight
evenings of that balmy latitude, talking of a thousand
things which, at other times, would have been
void of interest, or gazing silently upon the peaceful
scene around, with a hush upon our hearts it seemed
almost sacrilege to break. And at such times how
the merest trifle would afford us food for conversation,
or how eloquent would be the quiet of that
holy silence! Yes! the ripple of a wave, or the
glimmer of the spray, or the twinkling of a star, or
the voice of the night-wind sighing low, or the
deep, mysterious language of the unquiet ocean,
had, at such moments, a beauty in them, stirring
every chord in our hearts, and filling us, as it were,
with sympathy not only for each other, but for every
thing in Nature. And when we would part for the
night, I would pace for hours, my solitary watch,
thinking of Beatrice, with all the rapt devotion of a
first, pure love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this could not last. The dream was pleasant,
yet it might not lead me to dishonor. Beatrice
was under my protection, and was it right to avail
myself of that advantage to win her heart, when I
knew from the difference of our stations in life, that
it was madness to think that she could ever be
mine. What? the heiress of one of the richest
Jamaica residents, the grand-daughter of a baron,
and the near connexion of some of the wealthiest
tory families of the south, to be wooed as an equal
by one who not only had no fortune but his sword,
but was the advocate, in the eyes of her advisers, of
a rebellious cause! Nor did the service I had rendered
her lessen the difficulty of my position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These feelings, however, had rendered me more
guarded, perhaps more cold, in the presence of
Beatrice, for a day or two preceding our arrival in
port. I felt my case hopeless: and I wished, by
gradually avoiding the danger, to lessen the agony
of the final separation. Besides, I knew nothing
as yet of the sentiments of Beatrice toward myself.
I was a novice in love; and the silent abstraction
of her manner, together with the gradually increasing
avoidance of my presence, filled me with uneasiness,
despite the conviction of the hopelessness of my
suit. But what was it to me, I would say, even if
Beatrice loved me not? Was it not better that it
should be so? Alas! reason and love are two very
different things, and though I was better satisfied
with myself when we made the lights of Charleston
harbor, yet the almost total separation which had
thus for nearly two days existed between Beatrice
and myself, left my heart tormented with all a
lover’s fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last evening we would spend together,
perhaps for years. The wind had died away, and
we slowly floated upward with the tide, the shores
of James Island hanging like a dark cloud on the
larboard beam, and the lights of the distant city,
glimmering along the horizon inboard; while no
sound broke the stillness of the hour, except the
occasional wash of a ripple, or the song of some
negro fishermen floating across the water. As I
stood by the starboard railing, gazing on this
scenery, I could not help contrasting my present
situation with what it had been but a few short
weeks before, when I left the harbor of New York.
So intensely was I wrapt in these thoughts, that I
did not notice the appearance of Beatrice on deck,
until the question of the helmsman, dissolving my
reverie, caused me to look around me. For a moment
I hesitated whether I should join her or not.
My feelings at length, however, prevailed; and
crossing the deck, I soon stood at her side. She
did not appear to notice my presence, but with her
elbow resting on the railing, and her head buried
in her hand, was pensively looking down upon the
tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Derwent!” said I, with a voice that I was
conscious trembled, though I scarce knew why it
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Parker!” she ejaculated in a tone of surprise,
her eyes sparkling, as starting suddenly around
she blushed over neck and brow, and then as suddenly
dropped her eyes to the deck, and began
playing with her fan. For a moment we were both
mutually embarrassed. A woman is, at such times,
the first to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we be able to land to-night?” said Beatrice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless a breeze springs up—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! then I hope we shall not have one,” ejaculated
the guileless girl; but instantly becoming
aware of the interpretation which might be put upon
her remark, she blushed again, and cast her eyes
anew upon the deck. A strange, joyous hope shot
through my bosom; but I made a strong effort and
checked my feelings. Another silence ensued,
which every moment became more oppressive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You join, I presume, your cousin’s family on
landing,” said I at length, “I will, as soon as we
come to anchor, send a messenger ashore, apprising
him of your presence on board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shall I ever thank you sufficiently,” said
Beatrice, raising her dark eyes frankly to mine, “for
your kindness? Never—never,” she continued
more warmly, “shall I forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My soul thrilled to its deepest fibre at the words,
and more than all, at the tone of the speaker; and
it was with some difficulty that I could answer
calmly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The consciousness of having ever merited Miss
Derwent’s thanks, is a sufficient reward for all I
have done. That she will not wholly forget me is
more than I could ask; but believe me, Beatrice,”
said I, unable to restrain my feelings, and venturing,
for the first time, to call her by that name,
“though we shall soon part forever, never, never
can I forget these few happy days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—do you leave Charleston instantly?”
said she, with emotion, “shall I not see you again
after my landing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know not how it is, but there are moments
when our best resolutions vanish as though they
had never been made; and now, as I looked upon
the earnest countenance of Beatrice, and felt the
full meaning of the words so innocently said, a wild
hope once more shot across my bosom, and I said
softly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Beatrice, would it be aught to you whether
we ever met again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lifted her eyes up to mine, and gazed for an
instant almost reproachfully upon me, but she did
not answer. There was something, however, in
the look encouraging me to go on. I took her
hand: she did not withdraw it: and, in a few
hurried, but burning words, I poured forth my
love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Beatrice?” I said, “can you, do you love
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her dark eyes in answer up to mine,
with an expression I shall never forget, and murmured,
half inaudibly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know—you know I do,” and then overcome
by the consciousness of all she had done, she
burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can words describe my feelings? Oh! if I had
the eloquence of a Rosseau I could not portray the
emotions of that moment. They were wild; they
were almost uncontrollable. The tone, the words,
everything convinced me that I was beloved; and
all my well-formed resolutions were dissipated in a
moment. Had we been alone I would have caught
Beatrice to my bosom; but as it was, I could only
press her hand in silence. I needed not to be assured,
in more direct terms, of her affection. Henceforth
she was to me my all. She was the star of
my destiny!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first dawn of morning beheld us abreast of
the town, and at an early hour the equipage of Mr.
Rochester, the relative of Beatrice, and whose
guest she was now to be, was in waiting on the quay
for my beautiful charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will come to-night, will you not?” said
she, as I pressed her hand, on conducting her to
the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I bowed affirmatively, the door was closed, and
the sumptuous equipage, with its servants in livery,
moved rapidly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now that I had parted with Beatrice, that
the conviction of the almost utter hopelessness of
my suit forced itself upon my mind. Mr. Rochester
was the nearest male relative of Beatrice, being her
maternal uncle. Her parents were both deceased,
and the uncle, whose death I have related, together
with the Carolinian nabob, were, by her father’s
will, her guardians. Mr. Rochester was, therefore,
her natural protector. Her fortune, though large,
was fettered with a condition that she should not
marry without her guardian’s consent, and I soon
learned that a union had long been projected between
her and the eldest son of her surviving
guardian. How little hope I had before, the reader
knows, but that little was now fearfully diminished.
It is true Beatrice had owned that she loved me,
but how could I ask her to sacrifice the comforts
as well as the elegancies of life, to share her lot
with a poor unfriended midshipman? I could not
endure the thought. What! should I take advantage
of the gratitude of a pure young being—a
being, too, who had always been nourished in the
lap of luxury—to subject her to privation, and perhaps
to beggary? No, rather would I have lived
wholly absent from her presence. I could almost
have consented to lose her love, sooner than be the
instrument of inflicting on her miseries so crushing.
My only hope was in winning a name that would
yet entitle me to ask her hand as an equal: my
only fear was, lest the length of time I should be
absent from her side, would gradually lose me her
affection. Such is the jealous fear of a lover’s
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, however, the whole city resounded
with the din of war. A despatch from the Secretary
of Slate, to Gov. Eden, of Maryland, had been intercepted
by Com. Barron, of the Virginia service,
in the Chesapeake. From this missive, intelligence
was gleaned that the capital of South Carolina was
to be attacked; and on my arrival I found every
exertion being made to place it in a posture of
defence. I instantly volunteered, and the duties
thus assumed, engrossing a large part of my time,
left me little leisure, even for my suit. Still, however,
I occasionally saw Beatrice, though the cold
hauteur with which my visits were received by her
uncle’s family, much diminished their frequency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the time rolled on, however, and the British
fleet did not make its appearance, there were not
wanting many who believed that the contemplated
attack had been given up. But I was not of the
number. So firm, indeed, was my conviction of
the truth of the intelligence that I ran out to sea
every day or two, in a smart-sailing pilot-boat, in
order, if possible, to gain the first positive knowledge
of the approach of our foes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sail,” shouted our look-out one day, after we
had been standing off and on for several hours, “a
sail, broad on the weather-beam!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every eye was instantly turned toward the quarter
indicated; spy-glasses were brought into requisition;
and in a few minutes we made out distinctly nearly
a dozen sail, on the larboard tack, looming up on
the northern sea-board. We counted no less than
six men-of-war, besides several transports. Every
thing was instantly wet down to the trucks, and
heading at once for Charleston harbor, we soon
bore the alarming intelligence to the inhabitants of
the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night all was terror and bustle in the tumultuous
capital. The peaceful citizens, unused to
bloodshed, gazed upon the approaching conflict with
mingled resolution and terror, now determining to
die rather than to be conquered, and now trembling
for the safety of their wives and little ones. Crowds
swarmed the wharves, and even put out into the
bay to catch a sight of the approaching squadron.
At length it appeared off the bar, and we soon saw
by their buoying out the channel, that an immediate
attack was to take place by sea,—while expresses
brought us hasty intelligence of the progress made
by the royal troops in landing on Long Island. But
want of water among our foes, and the indecision
of their General, protracted the attack for more than
three weeks, a delay which we eagerly improved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, on the morning of the 28th of June,
it became evident that our assailants were preparing
to commence the attack. Eager to begin my
career of fame, I sought a post under Col. Moultrie,
satisfied that the fort on Sullivan’s Island would
have to maintain the brunt of the conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never shall I forget the sight which presented
itself to me on reaching our position. The fort we
were expected to maintain, was a low building of
palmetto logs, situated on a tongue of the island,
and protected in the rear from the royalist troops,
on Long Island, by a narrow channel, usually fordable,
but now, owing to the late prevalence of
easterly winds, providentially filled to a depth of
some fathoms. In front of us lay the mouth of the
harbor, commanded on the opposite shore, at the
distance of about thirty-five hundred yards, by another
fort in our possession, where Col. Gadsen,
with a respectable body of troops was posted. To
the right opened the bay, sweeping almost a quarter
of the compass around the horizon, toward the
north,—and on its extreme verge, to the north west,
rose up Haddrell’s point, where General Lee, our
commander-in-chief, had taken up a position. About
half way around, and due west from us, lay the city,
at the distance of nearly four miles, the view being
partly intercepted by the low, marshy island, called
Shute’s Folly, between us and the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have but twenty-eight pounds of powder,
Mr. Parker, a fact I should not like generally
known,” said Col. Moultrie to me, “but as you
have been in action before—more than I can say
of a dozen of my men—I know you may be trusted
with the information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never doubt the brave continentals here, colonel,”
I replied, “they are only four hundred, but we
shall teach yon braggarts a lesson, before to-day is
over, which they shall not soon forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo, my gallant young friend! With my
twenty-six eighteen and twenty four pounders, plenty
of powder, and a few hundred fire-eaters like yourself
I would blow the whole fleet out of water.
But after all,” said he with good-humored raillery,
“though you’ll not glory in rescuing Miss Derwent
to-day, you’ll fight not a whit the worse for
knowing that she is in Charleston, eh! But, come,
don’t blush—you must be my aid—I shall want
you, depend upon it, before the day is over. If
those red-coats here, behind us, attempt to take us
in the rear, we shall have hot work,—for by my
hopes of eternal salvation, I’ll drive them back,
man and officer, in spite of Gen. Lee’s fears that I
cannot. But ha! there comes the first bomb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking upward as he spoke, I beheld a large,
dark body flying through the air; and in the next
instant, amidst a cheer from our men, it splashed
into the morass behind us, simmered, and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well sent, old Thunderer,” ejaculated the imperturbable
colonel, “but, faith, many another good
bomb will you throw away on the swamps and
palmetto logs you sneer at. Open upon them, my
brave fellows, as they come around, and teach them
what Carolinians can do. Remember, you fight
to-day for your wives, your children, and your
liberties. The Continental Congress forever against
the minions of a tyrannical court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle was now begun. One by one the
British men-of-war, coming gallantly into their respective
stations, and dropping their anchors with
masterly coolness, opened their batteries upon us,
firing with a rapidity and precision that displayed
their skill. The odds against which we had
to contend were indeed formidable. Directly in
front of us, with springs on their cables, and supported
by two frigates, were anchored a couple of
two-deckers; while the three other men-of-war
were working up to starboard, and endeavoring to
get a position between us and the town, so as to
cut off our communications with Haddrell’s Point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it up—run her out again,” shouted the
captain of a gun beside me, who was firing deliberately,
but with murderous precision, every shot
of his piece telling on the hull of one of the British
cruizers, “huzza for Carolina!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes the broadside of Sir Peter’s two-decker,”
shouted another one, “make way for the
British iron among the palmetto logs. Ha! old
yellow breeches how d’ye like that?” he continued
as the shot from his piece, struck the quarter of the
flag-ship, knocking the splinters high into the air,
and cutting transversely through and through her
crowded decks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the three men-of-war attempting to
cut off our communications, had got entangled
among the shoals to our right, and now lay utterly
helpless, engaged in attempting to get afloat, and
unable to fire a gun. Directly two of them ran afoul,
carrying away the bowsprit of the smaller one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huzza!” shouted the old bruiser again, squinting
a moment in that direction, “they’re smashing
each other to pieces there without our help, and
so here goes at smashing their messmates in
front here—what the devil,” he continued, turning
smartly around to cuff a powder boy, “what are
you gaping up stream for, when you should be
waiting on me?—take that you varmint, and see if
you can do as neat a thing as this when you’re
old enough to point a gun. By the Lord Harry
I’ve cut away that fore-top-mast as clean as a
whistle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the conflict waxed hotter and hotter,
and through the long summer afternoon, except
during an interval when we slackened it for want
of powder, our brave fellows, with the coolness of
veterans, and the enthusiasm of youth, kept up
their fire. A patriotic ardor burned along our
lines, which only became more resistless, as the
wounded were carried past in the arms of their
comrades. The contest was at its height when
General Lee arrived from the mainland to offer to
remove us if we wished to abandon our perilous
position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abandon our position, General!” said Colonel
Moultrie, “will your excellency but visit the guns,
and ask the men whether they will give up the
fort? No, we will die or conquer here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eye of the Commander-in-Chief flashed
proudly at this reply, and stepping out upon the
plain, he approached a party who were firing with
terrible precision upon the British fleet. This
fearless exposure of his person called forth a cheer
from the men; but without giving him time to
remain long in so dangerous a position, Colonel
Moultrie exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brave fellows, the general has come off to
offer to remove you to the main if you are tired of
your post. Shall it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a universal negative, every man declaring
he would sooner die at his gun. It was a
noble sight. Their eyes flashing; their chests dilated;
their brawny arms bared and covered with
smoke, they stood there, determined, to a man, to
save their native soil at every cost, from invasion.
At this moment a group appeared, carrying a poor
fellow, whom it could be seen at a glance was
mortally wounded. His lips were blue; his countenance
ghastly; and his dim eye rolled uneasily
about. He breathed heavily. But as he approached
us, the shouts of his fellow soldiers falling on his
ear, aroused his dying faculties, and lifting himself
heavily up, his eye, after wandering inquiringly
about, caught the sight of his general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you! my poor fellow,” said Lee,
compassionately, “you are, I fear, seriously hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dying man looked at him as if not comprehending
his remark, and then fixing his eye
upon his general, said faintly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did not some one talk of abandoning the fort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Lee, “I offered to remove you
or let you fight it out—but I see you brave fellows
would rather die than retreat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Die!” said the wounded man, raising himself
half upright, with sudden strength, while his eye
gleamed with a brighter lustre than even in health.
“I thank my God that I am dying, if we can only
beat the British back. Die! I have no family, and
my life is well given for the freedom of my country.
No, my men, never retreat,” he continued, turning to
his fellow soldiers, and waving his arm around his
head, “huzza for li—i—ber—ty—huz—za—a—a,”
and as the word died away, quivering in his throat,
he fell back, a twitch passed over his face, and he
was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Need I detail the rest of that bloody day? For
nine hours, without intermission, the cannonade was
continued with a rapidity on the part of our foes,
and a murderous precision on that of ourselves,
such as I have never since seen equalled. Night
did not terminate the conflict. The long afternoon
wore away; the sun went down; the twilight came
and vanished; darkness reigned over the distant
shores around us, yet the flash of the guns, and the
roar of the explosions did not cease. As the evening
grew more obscure the whole horizon became illuminated
by the fire of our batteries, and the long,
meteor-like tracks of the shells through the sky.
The crash of spars; the shouts of the men; and
the thunder of the cannonade formed meanwhile a
discord as terrible as it was exciting; while the
lights flashing along the bay, and twinkling from
our encampment at Haddrell’s Point, made the
scene even picturesque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long was the conflict, and desperately did our enemies
struggle to maintain their posts. Even when
the cable of the flag-ship had been cut away, and
swinging around with her stern toward us, every
shot from our battery was enabled to traverse the
whole length of her decks, amid terrific slaughter,
she did not display a sign of fear, but doggedly
maintained her position, keeping up a straggling
fire upon us, for some time, from such of her guns
as could be brought to bear. At length, however,
a new cable was rigged upon her, and swinging
around broadside on, she resumed her fire. But it
was in vain. Had they fought till doomsday they
could not have overcome the indomitable courage
of men warring for their lives and liberties; and
finding that our fire only grew more deadly at
every discharge, Sir Peter Parker at length made
the signal to retire. One of the frigates farther in
the bay had grounded, however, so firmly on the
shoals that she could not be got off; and when she
was abandoned and fired next morning, our brave
fellows, despite the flames wreathing already around
her, boarded her, and fired at the retreating squadron
until it was out of range. They had not finally
deserted her more than a quarter of an hour before
she blew up with a stunning shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rejoicing among the inhabitants after this
signal victory were long and joyous. We were
thanked; feted; and became <span class='it'>lions</span> at once. The
tory families, among which was that of Mr. Rochester,
maintained, however, a sullen silence.
The suspicion which such conduct created made
it scarcely advisable that I should become a constant
visitor at his mansion, even if the cold civility
of his family had not, as I have stated before, furnished
other obstacles to my seeing Beatrice. Mr.
Rochester, it is true, had thanked me for the services
I had rendered his ward, but he had done so
in a manner frigid and reserved to the last degree,
closing his expression of gratitude with an offer of
pecuniary recompense, which not only made the
blood tingle in my veins, but detracted from the
value of what little he had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fortnight had now elapsed since I had seen
Beatrice, and I was still delayed at Charleston,
waiting for a passage to the north, and arranging
the proceeds of our prize, when I received an invitation
to a ball at the house of one of the leaders
of ton, who affecting a neutrality in politics, issued
cards indiscriminately to both parties. Feeling a
presentiment that Beatrice would be there, and
doubtless unaccompanied by her uncle or cousin,
I determined to go, and seek an opportunity to
bid her farewell, unobserved, before my departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rooms were crowded to excess. All that
taste could suggest, or wealth afford, had been
called into requisition to increase the splendor of
the <span class='it'>fete</span>. Rich chandeliers; sumptuous ottomans;
flowers of every hue; and an array of loveliness
such as I have rarely seen equalled, made the lofty
apartments almost a fairy palace. But amid that
throng of beauty there was but one form which
attracted my eye. It was that of Beatrice. She
was surrounded by a crowd of admirers, and I felt
a pang of almost jealousy, when I saw her, as I
thought, smiling as gaily as the most thoughtless
beauty present. But as I drew nearer I noticed
that, amid all her affected gaiety, a sadness would
momentarily steal over her fine countenance, like
a cloud flitting over a sunny summer landscape.
As I edged toward her through the crowd, her eye
caught mine, and in an instant lighted up with a
joyousness that was no longer assumed. I felt repaid,
amply repaid by that one glance, for all the
doubts I had suffered during the past fortnight; but
the formalities of etiquette prevented me from doing
aught except to return an answering glance, and
solicit the hand of Beatrice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! why have you been absent so long?” said
the dear girl, after the dance had been concluded,
and we had sauntered together, as if involuntarily,
into a conservatory behind the ball room, “every
one is talking of your conduct at the fort—do you
know I too am a rebel—and <span class='it'>do</span> you then sail
for the north?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dearest,” I replied, “and I have sought
you to-night to bid you adieu for months—it may
be for years. God only knows, Beatrice,” and I
pressed her hand against my heart, “when we shall
meet again. Perhaps you may not even hear from
me; the war will doubtless cut off the communications;
and sweet one, say will you still love me,
though others may be willing to say that I have
forgotten you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how can you ask me? But you—will—write—won’t
you?” and she lifted those deep,
dark, liquid eyes to mine, gazing confidingly upon
me, until my soul swam in ecstacy. My best answer
was a renewed pressure of that small, fair
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Beatrice,” said I, venturing upon a topic,
to which I had never yet alluded, “if they seek to
wed you to another will you—you still be mine
only?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you ask so cruel a question?” was
the answer, in a tone so low and sweet, yet half
reproachful, that no ear but that of a lover could
have heard it. “Oh! you know better—you
know,” she added, with energy, “that they have
already planned a marriage between me and my
cousin; but never, never can I consent to wed
where my heart goes not with my hand. And
now you know all,” she said tearfully, “and though
they may forbid me to think of you, yet I can never
forget the past. No, believe me, Beatrice Derwent
where once she has plighted her faith, will never
afterward betray it,” and overcome by her emotions,
the fair girl leaned upon my shoulder and
wept long and freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I will not protract the scene. Anew we
exchanged our protestations of love, and after waiting
until Beatrice had grown composed we returned
to the ball room. Under the plea of illness I
saw her soon depart, nor was I long in following.
No one, however, had noticed our absence. Her
haughty uncle, in his luxurious library, little suspected
the scene that had that night occurred. But
his conduct, I felt, had exonerated me from every
obligation to him, and I determined to win his
ward, if fortune favored me, in despite of his opposition.
My honor was no longer concerned against
me: I felt free to act as I chose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The British fleet meanwhile, having been seen no
more upon the coast, the communication with the
north, by sea, became easy again. New York,
however, was in the possession of the enemy, and a
squadron was daily expected at the mouth of Delaware
Bay. To neither of these ports, consequently,
could I obtain a passage. Nor indeed did I wish
it. There was no possibility that the <span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span>
would enter, either, to re-victual, and as I was anxious
to join her, it was useless to waste time in a port
where she could not enter. Newport held out the
only chance to me for rejoining my vessel. It was
but a day’s travel from thence to Boston, and at
one or the other of these places I felt confident the
<span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span> would appear before winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very day, however, after seeing Beatrice, I
obtained a passage in a brig, which had been bound
to another port, but whose destination the owners
had changed to Newport, almost on the eve of sailing.
I instantly made arrangements for embarking in
her, having already disposed of our prize, and invested
the money in a manner which I knew would
allow it to be distributed among the crew of the
<span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span> at the earliest opportunity. My parting
with Col. Moultrie was like parting from a father.
He gave me his blessing; I carried my kit on
board; and before forty-eight hours I was once
more at sea.</p>

<p class='line0'>Then, as he breathless paused, and faint,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The shout of joy that pealed on high</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As broke that landscape on his eye,</p>
<p class='line0'>Imaginings alone can paint.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Down on the granite brow, his prey,</p>
<p class='line0'>In all its antlered glory lay.</p>
<p class='line0'>His plumage flowed above the spoil—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;His quiver, and the slackened bow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Companions of his ceaseless toil,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Lay careless at its side below.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Oh! who might gaze, and not grow brighter,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;More pure, more holy, and serene;</p>
<p class='line0'>Who might not feel existence lighter</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Beneath the power of such a scene?</p>
<p class='line0'>Marking the blush of light ascending</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;From where the sun had set afar,</p>
<p class='line0'>Tinting each fleecy cloud, and blending</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With the pale azure; while each star</p>
<p class='line0'>Came smiling forth ’mid roseate hue,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And deepened into brighter lustre</p>
<p class='line0'>As Night, with shadowy fingers threw</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her dusky mantle round each cluster.</p>
<p class='line0'>Purple, and floods of gold, were streaming</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Around the sunset’s crimson way,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all the impassioned west was gleaming</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With the rich flush of dying day.</p>
<p class='line0'>Far, far below the wandering sight,</p>
<p class='line0'>Seen through the gath’ring gloom of night,</p>
<p class='line0'>A mighty river rushing on,</p>
<p class='line0'>Seemed dwindled to a fairy’s zone.</p>
<p class='line0'>No bark upon its wave was seen,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Or if ’twas there, it glided by</p>
<p class='line0'>As viewless forms, that once have been,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Will flit, half-seen, before the eye.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Long gazed the hunter on that sight,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Till twilight darkened into night,</p>
<p class='line0'>Dim and more dim the landscape grew,</p>
<p class='line0'>And duskier was the empyrean blue;</p>
<p class='line0'>Glittered a thousand stars on high,</p>
<p class='line0'>And wailed the night-wind sadly by;</p>
<p class='line0'>And slowly fading, one by one,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Cliff, cloud, ravine, and mountain pass</p>
<p class='line0'>Grew darker still, and yet more dun,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;’Till deep’ning to a shadowy mass,</p>
<p class='line0'>They seemed to mingle, earth and sky,</p>
<p class='line0'>In one wild, weird-like canopy.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yet lo! that hunter starts, and one</p>
<p class='line0'>Whom it were heaven to gaze upon,</p>
<p class='line0'>A beauteous girl,—as ’twere a fawn,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;So playful, wild, and gentle too,—</p>
<p class='line0'>Came bounding o’er the shadowy lawn,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With step as light, and love as true.</p>
<p class='line0'>It was Echucha! she, his bride,</p>
<p class='line0'>Dearer than all of earth beside,—</p>
<p class='line0'>For she had left her sire’s far home,</p>
<p class='line0'>The woodland depths with him to roam</p>
<p class='line0'>Who was that sire’s embittered foe!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And there, in loveliness alone,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With him her opening beauty shone.</p>
<p class='line0'>But even while he gazed, that form,</p>
<p class='line0'>As fades the lightning in the storm,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Passed quickly from his sight.</p>
<p class='line0'>He looked again, no one was there,</p>
<p class='line0'>No voice was on the stilly air,</p>
<p class='line0'>No step upon the greensward fair,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But all around was night.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She past, but thro’ that hunter’s mind,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;What wild’ring memories are rushing,</p>
<p class='line0'>As harps, beneath a summer wind,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With wild, mysterious lays are gushing.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Fast came rememb’rance of that eve,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Whose first wild throb of earthly bliss</p>
<p class='line0'>Was but to gaze, and to receive</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The boon of hope so vast as this—</p>
<p class='line0'>To clasp that being as his own,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To win her from her native bowers;</p>
<p class='line0'>And form a spirit-land, alone</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With her amid perennial flowers.</p>
<p class='line0'>And as he thought, that dark, deep eye,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Seemed hovering as ’twas wont to bless,</p>
<p class='line0'>When the soft hand would on him lie,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And sooth his soul to happiness.</p>

<p class='line0'>Bursting at length to mid-day flame,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And bathing hill and vale in light.</p>

<p class='line0'>The morning songster skims along</p>
<p class='line0'>Preceded by his matchless song.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Waved darkly on each snowy shoulder,—</p>
<p class='line0'>As springing from the mountain’s brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Eager and wild that one to know,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Again ’twas dawn: that hunter’s gaze</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Was wand’ring o’er a wide expanse</p>
<p class='line0'>Of inland lake, half hid in haze</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That waved beneath the morning’s glance.</p>
<p class='line0'>The circling wood, so still and deep</p>
<p class='line0'>Its sombre hush, seemed yet asleep;</p>
<p class='line0'>Save when at intervals from tree</p>
<p class='line0'>A lone bird woke its minstrelsy,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or flitting off from spray to spray</p>
<p class='line0'>’Mid glittering dew pursued its way.</p>
<p class='line0'>When lo! upon the list’ning ear</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The rustling of a distant tread,</p>
<p class='line0'>That pausing oft drew ever near</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A causeless apprehension spread.</p>
<p class='line0'>And from a nook, a snow-white Hind</p>
<p class='line0'>Came bounding—beauteous of its kind!—</p>
<p class='line0'>Seeking the silver pebbled strand</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Within the tide her feet to lave,</p>
<p class='line0'>E’re noonday’s sun should wave his wand</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of fire across the burnished wave.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Never hath mortal eye e’er seen</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Such fair proportion blent with grace;</p>
<p class='line0'>A creature with so sweet a mien</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Might only find its flitting place</p>
<p class='line0'>In that bright land far, far away</p>
<p class='line0'>Where Indian hunters, legends say,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Pursue the all-enduring chase.</p>
<p class='line0'>The beautifully tapered head,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The slender ear, the eye so bright,</p>
<p class='line0'>The curving neck, the agile tread,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The strength, the eloquence, the flight</p>
<p class='line0'>Of limbs tenuitively small,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Seemed imaged forth, a thing of light</p>
<p class='line0'>Springing at Nature’s magic call.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The sparkling surge broke at her feet,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Rippling upon the pebbly brink,</p>
<p class='line0'>As gracefully its waters sweet</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She curved her glossy neck to drink.</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet scarce she tasted, ere she gazed</p>
<p class='line0'>Wildly around like one amazed,</p>
<p class='line0'>With head erect, and eye of fear,</p>
<p class='line0'>And trembling, quick-extended ear.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Still as the serpent’s hushed advance,</p>
<p class='line0'>The hunter, with unmoving glance,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wound on to where a beech-tree lay</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Half buried in the snowy sand:</p>
<p class='line0'>He crouches ’neath its sapless spray</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To nerve his never-failing hand.</p>
<p class='line0'>A whiz—a start—her rolling eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Hath caught the danger lurking nigh.</p>
<p class='line0'>She flies, but only for a space;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then turns with sad reproachful face;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then rallying forth her wonted strength,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She backward threw her matchless head,</p>
<p class='line0'>Flung on the wind her tap’ring length,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And onward swift and swifter sped,—</p>
<p class='line0'>O’er sward, and plain, and snowy strand,</p>
<p class='line0'>By mossy rocks, through forests grand,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which there for centuries had stood</p>
<p class='line0'>Rustling in their wild solitude.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>On, on, in that unwearied chase</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With tireless speed imbued,</p>
<p class='line0'>Went sweeping with an eldrich pace</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Pursuing and pursued!</p>
<p class='line0'>’Till, as the sinking orb of day,</p>
<p class='line0'>Glowed brighter with each dying ray,</p>
<p class='line0'>The fleetness of that form was lost,</p>
<p class='line0'>Dark drops of blood her pathway crost,</p>
<p class='line0'>And faint and fainter drooped that head,—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She falters—sinks—one effort more—</p>
<p class='line0'>’Tis vain—her noontide strength has fled—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She falls upon the shore.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>One eager bound—the Hunter’s knife</p>
<p class='line0'>Sank deep to end her struggling life;</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet, e’en as flashed the murd’rous blade,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;There came a shrill and plaintive cry:</p>
<p class='line0'>The Hind was not—a beauteous maid</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Lay gasping with upbraiding eye.</p>
<p class='line0'>The glossy head and neck were gone,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The snowy furs that clasped her round;</p>
<p class='line0'>And in their place the peag zone,</p>
<p class='line0'>And raven hair that all unbound</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon her heaving bosom lies</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And mingles with the rushing gore,</p>
<p class='line0'>The sandaled foot, the fawn-like eyes;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;All, all are there—he needs no more—</p>
<p class='line0'>“Echucha—ha!” The dream hath passed;</p>
<p class='line0'>Cold clammy drops were thick and fast</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Upon the awakened warrior’s brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the wild eye that flashed around</p>
<p class='line0'>To penetrate the dark profound,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Seemed fired with Frenzy’s glow.</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet all was still, while far above,</p>
<p class='line0'>Nestling in calm and holy love,</p>
<p class='line0'>The watchful stars intensely bright</p>
<p class='line0'>Gleamed meekly through the moonless night.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The Hunter gazed,—and from his brow</p>
<p class='line0'>Passed slowly off that fevered glow,</p>

<p class='line0'>He raised his quiver from his side,</p>

<div><h1><a id='mygran'></a>MY GRANDMOTHER’S TANKARD.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY JESSE E. DOW.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My</span> grandmother was one of the old school.
She was a fine, portly built old lady, with a smart
laced cap. She hated snuff and spectacles, and
never lost her scissors, because she always kept
them fastened to her side by a silver chain. As
for scandal she never indulged in its use, believing,
as she said, that truth was stranger than fiction and
twice as cutting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My grandmother had a penchant for old times
and old things, she delighted to dwell upon the
history of the past, and once a year on the day of
thanksgiving and prayer, she appeared in all the
glories of a departed age. Her head bore an enormous
cushion—her waist was doubly fortified with
a stomacher of whale-bone and brocade. Her skirt
spread out its ample folds of brocade and embroidery
below, flanked by two enormous pockets. Her
well-turned ankles were covered with blue worsted
stockings, with scarlet clocks, and her underpinning
was completed by a pair of high quartered russet
shoes mounted upon a couple of extravagant red
heels. When the hour for service drew near, she
added a high bonnet of antique form, made of black
satin, and a long red cloak of narrow dimensions.
Thus clothed, as she ascended the long slope that
led to the old Presbyterian meeting house, she appeared
like a British grenadier with his arms shot
off, going to the pay office for his pension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her memory improved by age, for she doubtless
recollected some things which never happened, and
her powers of description were equal to those of
Sir Walter Scott’s old crone, whose wild legends
awoke the master’s mind to a sense of its own high
powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My grandmother came through the revolution a
buxom dame, and her legends of cow boys and
tories, of white washed chimnies and tar and featherings,
of battles by sea, and of “skrimmages,” as
she termed them, by land, would have filled a volume
as large as Fox’s book of the Martyrs, and made in
the language of the day a far more <span class='it'>readable work</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was her pet—her auditor: I knew when to
smile, and when to look grave—when to approach
her, and when to retire from her presence; her
pocket was my paradise, and her old cup-board my
seventh heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many a red streaked apple and twisted doughnut
have I munched from the former,—and many a
Pisgah glimpse have I had of the bright pewter and
brighter silver that garnished the latter. Among
the old lady’s silver was a venerable massive tankard
that had come down from the early settlers
of Quinapiack, and she prized it far above many
weightier and more useful vessels. This relic always
attracted my notice—a coat of arms was
pictured upon one side of it, and underneath it the
family name in old English letters, stood out like
letters upon an iron sign. It was of London
manufacture, and must have been in use long before
the Pilgrims sailed for Plymouth. It had,
doubtless, been drained by cavaliers and roundheads
in the sea girt isle,</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of this venerable relic was my grandmother’s
hobby, and as she is no longer with us
to relate the story herself, I will hand it down in
print, that posterity, if so disposed, may know
something also of</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>MY GRANDMOTHER’S TANKARD.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> the year 1636, a company of fighting men
from the Massachusetts colony, pursued a party
of Pequots to the borders of a swamp in the present
county of Fairfield, in Connecticut, and destroyed
them by fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldiers on their return to the colony spoke
in rapture of a goodly land through which they
passed in the south country, bordering upon a river
and bay, called by the Indians Quinapiack, and by
the Dutch the Vale of the Red Rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1637, the New Haven company,
beaten out by the toils and privations of a long
and boisterous voyage across the Atlantic, landed
at the mouth of the Charles River, and continued
for a season inactive in the pleasant tabernacles of
the early pilgrims. Hearing of the fair and goodly
land beyond the Connectiquet, or Long River, and
disliking the sterile shores of Massachusetts bay,
the newly arrived company sent spies into the land
to view the second Canaan, and bring them a true
report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1638, having received a favorable account
from the pioneers, the company embarked, and
sailed for that fair land, and at the close of the
tenth day the Red Rocks appeared frowning grimly
against the western horizon, and the Quinapiack
spread out its silver bosom to receive them. The
vessel that brought the colony, landed them on the
eastern shore of a little creek now filled up and
called the meadows, about twenty rods from the
corner of College and George streets, in New
Haven, and directly opposite to the famous old
oak, under whose broad branches Mr. Davenport
preached his first sermon to the settlers, “Upon
the Temptations of the Wilderness.” Time, that
rude old gentleman, has wrought many changes in
the harbor of Quinapiack since the days of the
pilgrims; and a regiment of purple cabbages are
now growing where the adventurers’ bark rested
her wave-worn keel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1638, having laid out a city of nine squares,
the company met in Newman’s barn, and formed
their constitution. At this meeting it was ordered
that the laws of Moses should govern the colony
until the elders had time to make better ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theophilus Eaton, Esq. was chosen the first
governor: and the whole power of the people was
vested in the governor, Mr. Davenport, the minister,
his deacon, and the seven pillars of the church
of Quinapiack. Here was church and state with
a vengeance, and the pilgrims who sought freedom
to worship God found freedom to worship him as
they pleased, provided they worshipped him <span class='it'>as Mr.
Davenport</span> directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seven pillars of the church were wealthy
laymen, and were its principal support; among the
number I find the names of those staunch old colonists,
Matthew Gilbert and John Panderson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Governor Eaton was an eminent merchant in
London, and when he arrived at Quinapiack, his
ledger was transformed into a book of records for
the colony. It is now to be seen with his accounts
in one end of it, and the records in the other. The
principal settlers of New Haven were rich London
merchants. They brought with them great wealth,
and calculated in the new world to engage in commerce,
free from the trammels that clogged them
in England. They could not be contented with
the old colony location. They now found a beautiful
harbor—a fine country—and a broad river:
but no trade. Where all were sellers there could
be no buyers. They had stores but no customers:
ships but no Wapping: and they soon began to sigh
for merry England, and the wharves of crowded
marts. In three years after landing at New Haven,
a large number of these settlers determined to return
to their native land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly a vessel was purchased in Rhode
Island, a crazy old tub of a thing that bade fair to
sail as fast broadside on as any way, whose sails
were rotten with age, and whose timbers were
pierced by the worms of years. Having brought
the vessel round to New Haven, the colonists,
under the direction of the old ship master Lamberton,
repaired and fitted her for sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day before Captain Lamberton intended to
sail, Eugene Foster, the son of a wealthy merchant
in London, and Grace Gilman, the daughter of one
of the wealthy worthies of Quinapiack, wandered
out of the settlement and ascended the East Rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Gilman was the niece of my great, great
grandmother. Possessing a brilliant mind, a lovely
countenance, and a form of perfect symmetry, she
occupied no small share of every single gentleman’s
mind asleep or awake, in the colony. Her dark
hair hung in ringlets about a neck of alabaster, and
sheltered with smaller curls a cheek where the lily
and the rose held sweet communion together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Foster had followed the object of his love to her
western home, and having gained Elder Gilman’s
consent to his union with the flower of Quinapiack,
he was now ready to return in the vessel to his
native land, for the purpose of preparing for a
speedy settlement in the colony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eugene Foster was a noble, spirited youth, of
high literary attainments. Besides his frequent excursions
with the scouts, had made him an experienced
woodman and hunter. His countenance was pleasant;
his eye possessed the fire of genius; and his
form was tall and commanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a glorious morning in autumn. The
whole space around the settlement was one vast
forest, and the frost had tipped the leaves of the
trees with russet crimson and gold. The bare
sumac lifted its red core on high, and the crab
apple hung its bright fruit over every crag. The
maple shook its blood-colored leaves around, and
the chesnut and walnut came pattering down from
their lofty heights, like hail from a summer cloud.
The heath hens sate drumming the morning away
upon the mouldering trunks, whose tops had waved
above the giants of the forest in former ages. The
grey squirrel sprang from limb to limb. The flying
squirrel sailed from tree to tree in his downward
flight; and the growling wild cat glided swiftly
down the vistas of the wood with her shrieking
prey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blue jay piped all hands from the deep
woods—and the hawk, as he sailed over the partridge’s
brood, shrieked the wild death cry of the
air. A haze rested upon the distant heights, and
a cloud of mellow light rolled over the little settlement,
and faded into silver upon the broad sound
that stretched out before it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly noon when the lovers—whose
conversation on such an occasion I must leave the
reader to imagine—turned from the enchanting
prospect, which at this day exceeds any thing
in America—to return to the settlement. Two
Indians, of the Narragansett tribe, now bounded
from the thicket, and before Foster could bring his
musketoon to its rest—for he always went armed—they
levelled him to the earth. A green withe was
speedily twined around his arms, and he was apparently
as powerless as a child. Grace sprang to a
little path that led to the parapet of the bluff and
screamed for help; that scream was her salvation,
for the Indian who was binding Foster’s hands, left
the withe loose, and sprang toward her. In a moment
the rude hand of the red-man rested heavily
upon her shoulder, and his grim look sent the blood
tingling from her cheeks. Another withe was
speedily passed around her arms, and then the two
Narragansetts seated themselves to make a hurdle
to bear the pale faced maiden away. As they were
busily engaged Grace heard a whisper behind her.
She turned her head half round—Foster, by great
exertions, had got loose from his withe, and was
crawling slowly toward his musketoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Narragansetts, suspecting nothing, were sitting
behind a little clump of sassafras, and nothing
but their brawny chests could be seen through a
small bend in the trunks of the trees that composed
the thicket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stealthily crept the experienced Foster to the tree
where his musketoon rested. Not a crackling twig,
nor rustling leaf, gave the slightest evidence of his
movements. The Indians spoke in their own wild
gutterals of the beauty of the pale-faced squaw, and
chuckled with delight at the speedy prospect of
roasting the young long knife by Philip’s council fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The musketoon was just as he had left it: not a
grain of powder had left the pan,—the match burned
brightly at the butt, and every thing seemed to be
as effective as possible. Foster seized it and motioned
to Grace to stoop her head, so as to give
him a chance to bring the red men in a range
through the opening in the thicket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace bent her head to the ground, while her
heart beat with fearful anticipation. The young
pilgrim aimed his deadly weapon, as a fine opportunity
presented itself. The two savages were sitting
cross-legged, side by side, and their brawny breasts
were seen, one bending slightly before the other.
Foster aimed so as to give each a fair proportion
of slugs—for he had a charge for a panther in his
barrel—and fired. A loud report rang down the
aisles of the forest, and rattled in echoes over the
settlement, while the two Indians bounded up with
a fearful yell, and fell dead upon the half-made
hurdle. Foster sprang to the side of Grace, and
casting loose the withe that confined her swollen
arms, bore her over the bodies of the Narragansetts,
whose horrid scowls never were forgotten by the
affrighted maid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A war-whoop now rang in the usual pathway to
the settlement, and Foster saw that he must take a
shorter cut or die. Grace had fainted, and every
thing depended upon his manliness and strength.
He therefore approached the brink of the precipice.
A wild grape vine, that had grown there since the
morning of time, for aught he knew, extended far
up the perpendicular rock, from a crag below. He
bound the fair girl to his breast with his neckcloth
and shot-belt, and grasping the stem of the vine,
descended. As he slipped down, the vine began to
yield, and just as his foot touched the narrow crag,
the whole vine, with a mass of loose earth and
stones, gave way with a tremendous crash, and
hung, from the crevice where he stood, like a feather
quivering beneath his feet. Foster was for a
moment dizzy, but he cast his eyes upward, and
beheld the eyes of an Indian glaring upon him from
the top of the rock. He was nerved in a moment:
and seeing a ledge a foot and a half broad, beyond
a fissure, about eight feet over, and very deep, he
determined to spring for it. Grace Gilman, however,
was a dead weight to the young man, and he
feared the result. The ledge seemed to run at an
angle of forty-five degrees along the front of the
rock, to a side hill, formed by fallen rocks and
earth. A wild vine hung down over the fissure,
covered with tempting fruit. He reached out his
hand and grasped the main stem as it waved in the
breeze,—it was strong, and its roots seemed firmly
imbedded in a crevice above him. Commending
himself to that Creator whose tireless eye takes in
at a glance his creatures, he made his leap! The
damp wind from the fissure rushed by his ears; the
vine cracked and rustled above him; rich clusters
of luscious fruit came tumbling upon his head; and
the birds of night came shrieking out from their
dark shelters in the fissure as he swung past. Foster,
however, did not waver, his foot struck the
ledge and he leaned forward; the vine flew back
like a pendulum as he let it go, and he slid down
the smooth ridge of the ledge in safety. In a short
time he brought up against a heap of earth that
had fallen from the mountain top, and springing up,
bounded like the chamois hunter from crag to crag,
until he stood upon the broad bottom, without a
bruise or a scratch upon himself or his fair charge.
In twenty minutes the young pilgrim entered the
settlement by the forest way, with the almost lifeless
form of his beloved buckled to his breast, while
savage yells of disappointment came down from the
summit of the East Rock, and caused the young
mothers of Quinapiack to press their startled babes
closer to their trembling hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None had dared to follow the adventurous pilgrim’s
course down the mountain’s perpendicular
side: and the ledges that jut out like faint shadows
from the bluff, are called Foster’s Stepping Stone
by those who know the incident to this day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the musketoon was heard in the
settlement. The soldiers of the colony stood to
their arms, and when Foster had made his report,
several strong parties went out upon a scout; but
it was of no use; drops of blood only were discovered
sprinkled upon the sassafras-leaves, and a
heavy trail leading toward the Long River. The
fighting men of Quinapiack, after a weary march,
gave up the pursuit of the Narragansetts, and returned
leisurely to the settlement. Night now settled
like a raven upon the land—the drums beat
to prayers—one by one the lights went out in the
cottages of the pilgrims; and as the watch-fire sent
forth its ruddy blaze from the common—now the college
green—the colony slumbered in sweet forgetfulness,
or wandered in visions amid the scenes of their
childhood by the broad Shannon or the silver Ayr.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who can tell the strange thoughts that agitated
the sleepers’ souls? The old men, had they no
pleasures of memory? The young men and the
maidens, had they no dreams of joy—no bright
pictures of trysting trees and lovely glens where
the white lady moved in her noiseless path, or the
fairies danced on the moonlight sward? Had the
politician no dream of departed power? No sigh
for his rapid fall? Had the soldier no dream of
glory—no sound of stirring bugles melting upon
his ear? Had the minister of God no dream of
greatness—when before the kings and princes of
the world he stood? and like Nathan of old said
in Christ-like majesty to the offending monarch—</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Thou art the man.”</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was sunrise at Quinapiack, and the seven pillars
were no longer seven sleepers. Eugene Foster
stood beside Grace Gilman, while the old elder
wrestled valiantly in prayer. When the morning
service was ended, and a substantial breakfast had
been stowed away with no infant’s hand, Foster
imprinted a kiss upon the cheek of the bashful
puritan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell, Grace,” said he, “we are ready to
sail. In a few months more the smoke shall curl
from my cottage chimney, and the good people of
the colony shall wait at the council board for good
man Foster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eugene,” said Grace, with eyes suffused with
tears, “your time will pass pleasantly in England;
but, oh! how long will the period of your absence
seem in this lone outpost of civilization. Do not,
then, tarry in the land of your fathers beyond the
time necessary for accomplishing your business.
There are many Graces in England, but there are
but few Fosters here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace,” said Foster blushing, “there is no
Grace in England like the Grace of Quinapiack,
and he who would leave the blooming rose of the
wilderness, for the sick lily of the hot-house,
deserves not to enjoy the fresh blessings of Providence.
The wind that blows back to the western
continent shall fill my sails, and I will claim my
bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old puritan now gave the young man his
blessing. Foster drew from his cloak fold this silver
tankard,—marked, as you now see it,—[so said my
grandmother, as she held the antique vessel up to
the light,] and presented it to Grace as an earnest
of his love. The elder, after seeing that it was pure
silver, exclaimed against the gew-gaws, and the
drinking measures of a carnal world, and left the
room. Two hearty kisses were now heard, even
by the domestics in the Gilman family. The elder
entered the breakfast room in haste; Eugene bounded
out of the door—Grace glided like a fairy up stairs,
and the old tankard rested upon the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After placing on board of the return ship the
massive plate, and other valuables of the discontented
merchants, those whose hearts failed them, embarked
amid the tears and prayers of Davenport and his
faithful associates. The sails were spread to the
breeze—the old ship bowed her head to the foam,
and dashed out of the harbor in gallant style.
Grace watched the vessel as she departed, and when
the evening came, she wept in her silent chamber,
for her heart was sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a sad day for the remaining colonists
when the ship dipped her topsails in the southern
waves. A feeling of loneliness, such as the traveller
feels when lost in a boundless wood, seized upon
them, and the staunchest wept for their native land,
and the air was damp with tears. The next morning
the settlement became more cheerful, for what
can raise the drooping soul like the still glories of a
New England autumn morning? The ship would,
in all probability, return in a few months with necessary
stores for the colonists, and then, should the
company grow weary of the new country, they could
return to their native land with their wives, and recount
to kind friends the perils of an ocean voyage,
and of a solitary home in a savage land.</p>

<hr class='tbk108'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Six</span> long and melancholy months rolled away,
and no tidings of the pilgrims’ ship had reached the
ears of the anxious settlers of Quinapiack. A vessel
had arrived at Plymouth after a short passage, but
nothing had been heard of Lamberton’s bark when
she sailed. A terrible mystery hung over the ill-filled
and crazy ship. Autumn now came in its
beauty, and still no tidings came to cheer the sinking
soul, and gladden the heavy heart. Grace
Gilman now began to pine, like the fair flower,
whose root the worm of destruction has struck, and
whose brightness slowly fades away. At length the
good people of Quinapiack could stand this state of
suspense no longer, and the Rev. Mr. Davenport,
and his little flock, besought the Lord with sighs
and tears, and heartfelt prayers to shew them the
fate of their friends by a visible sign from heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four successive Sabbaths the worthy minister
strove for a revelation of the mystery, and on the
afternoon of the last day, when silence brooded over
the settlement; when even the barn-fowl grew
silent upon his roost, and the well-trained dog lay
watching by the old family clock, for sunset, and
the hour of play, the cry came up from the water
side,—“A sail! a sail!”—and the drums beat with
a double note, and the gravest leaped for joy. The
cry operated like an electric shock upon the whole
mass of the people. The old and the young, the
sick and the well, went out upon the shore to view
the approaching stranger, and the seaman stood by
the landing place ready to make her fast. Grace
Gilman was in the centre of the throng, and the
worthy minister, Davenport, waited silently by her
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no moment so full of interest to us as
that when a vessel from our native land approaches
us upon a distant shore. How many anxious hearts
are waiting to rise or fall, as good or bad tidings
salute their ears. How many watch the faces that
throng the deck, and turn from countenance to
countenance with eager look, until their eyes rest
upon some familiar face, and their anxiety is satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are cold hearts also in such a crowd,—worldly
men, who come to gather news. What
care they for affection’s warm greeting, or the throb
of sympathy? What know they of a sister’s love;
aye! or of that deeper love which only exists in the
breast of woman! which carried her to Pilate’s
hall, to Calvary’s scene of blood, and to Joseph’s
tomb? The price of cotton, of tobacco, bread-stuffs,
rise of fancy stocks, election of a favorite
candidate, or the death of a rich relative, are sweeter
than angel whispers to their ears, and <span class='it'>a rise of two
pence on corn</span> is enough to fill a whole exchange
with raptures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were but few such worldlings on the landing
place of Quinapiack on the Sabbath eve when
the gallant vessel of the pilgrims approached the
shore. Silence reigned upon the landing, and a
dreadful stillness hung over the approaching ship.
Gallantly she entered the harbor, and the boldest on
shore trembled for her temerity in carrying such a
press of canvass. Not a sail had she handed—not
a man was aloft. Her course varied not—neither
did the water ripple before her bows. All was now
anxiety. A hail went forth from the land,—a
moment of breathless curiosity passed, but no answer
came. Another hail was treated with the same
neglect. At length Mr. Davenport hailed the
stranger. As the words slowly burst from the
brazen trumpet, a bright ray of sunlight gleamed
full upon the vessel. Her top-masts now faded into
air—then the sails and rigging down to her courses—her
ensign next rolled away upon the breeze, and
when the East Rock sent back the last echo of the
trumpet, the pilgrims’ ship had vanished away. A
similar ship, though of much smaller dimensions,
now appeared upon a heavy cloud that hung over
Long Island, and faded away with the brightness of
the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the promised sign,” said Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our friends are lost at sea,” cried the multitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eugene is drowned!” screamed Grace Gilman,
and the crowd dispersed to weep alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the throng moved away from the water side,
a maniac girl who had been gathering wild flowers
upon the East Rock, came running in from the
forest way, chaunting the following words to a
plaintive air:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Upon</span> a couch, in a little parlor in Quinapiack,
surrounded by a number of the worthy settlers of
both sexes, rested, at the close of that Sabbath day,
Grace Gilman. Her cup of sorrow was full, and
she prayed for the approach of the angel of death.
Beside her stood the silver tankard, and her dim
eye endeavored in vain to read the inscription.
“Aunt Tabitha,” said the sufferer to my great great
grandmother, “read the inscription for me.” The
good aunt bent over the vessel, and read aloud:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” said Mr. Davenport, as he slowly
entered the room, “why weepest thou? Daughter
of the church, why sittest thou in sadness? Children
of God, why shed these useless tears? Arise, and
let us bless the Lord, for he is good, and his mercy
endureth forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The broken-hearted girl folded her hands. The
aged father bent over her pillow. The friends
leaned upon their staves, and the minister poured
forth his soul in unstudied prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sweet strain of thrilling music now broke upon
the ear,—a sound of gentle voices echoed in the
hall,—a rustling of wings was heard overhead,—a
faint whisper of “Eugene! Eugene! I—come—”
died away on the sufferer’s pillow: and when the
prayer was ended, the little company found themselves
alone, watchers with the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Gilman had breathed her last, and the
betrothed of the pilgrim joined her lover in heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> poor girl was buried agreeably to her wishes,
upon the mountain side. The tankard became the

when the Sabbath evening commences, the rustic
swain, as he passes the foot of the mountain, fancies
that he sees a white figure beckoning to him from
the cliff, and hears, amid the sighing of the woods,
a low, but fearfully distinct whisper, saying—“Eugene!
Eugene! I come!” And oft since, through
the dim twilight of a summer’s Sabbath evening,
has been seen the spirit-ship of the long-lost Pilgrims,
ploughing her unruffled course through the
calm waters of Quinapiack, and, when hailed, instantly
disappearing.</p>

<div><h1><a id='resc'></a>THE RESCUED KNIGHT.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-weight:bold;'>A TALE OF THE CRUSADES.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was starlight on Galilee. The placid lake
lay at the feet, slumbering as calmly as an infant,
with the wooded shores, and the tall cliffs around,
reflected darkly in its surface. Scarcely a breath
disturbed the quiet air. Occasionally a ripple
would break on the shore with a low, measured
harmony, and anon a tiny wave would glisten in
the starlight, as a slight breeze ruffled the surface
of the lake. The song of the fisherman was hushed;
the voice of the vine-dresser had ceased on the
shore; the cry of the eagle had died away amongst
his far-off hills, and the silence of midnight, deep,
hushed, and awe-inspiring, hung over Galilee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thousand years before, and what scenes had
that sea beheld! There, had lived Peter and his
brethren; there, had our Saviour taught; upon those
shores had his miracles been wrought; and on the
broad bosom of Gennesserat he had walked a God.
What holy memories were linked in with that little
sea! How calm and changeless seemed its quiet
depths! A thousand years had passed since then,
and the apostles and their children had mouldered
into dust, yet the stars still looked down on that
placid lake unchanged, shining the same as they had
done for fifty centuries before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the shore of the lake, embowered in the
thick woods, stood a large old, rambling fortified
building, bearing traces of the Roman architecture,
upon which had been engrafted a Saracenic style.
It enclosed a garden, upon one side of which was
a range of low buildings, dark, massy, frowning, and
partly in ruins, but which bore every evidence of
being still almost impregnable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within this range of buildings, in a dark and
noisome cell, reclined, upon a scanty bed of straw,
a Christian knight. His face was pale and attenuated,
but it had lost, amid all his sufferings, none of
his high resolve. It was now the seventh day since
he had lain in that loathsome dungeon, and the
morrow’s sun was to see him die a martyr, for not
abjuring his religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” he muttered to himself, “the agony will
soon be over: it is but an hour at the most, and
shall a Christian knight fear fire or torture? No:
come when it may, death should ever be welcome
to a de Guiscan; and how much more welcome
when it brings the glories of martyrdom. But yet
it is a fearful trial. I could fall in battle, for there
a thousand eyes behold us, but to die alone, unheard
of, with only foes around, and where none shall
ever hear of my fate.—Oh! that indeed is bitter.
Yet I fear not even it. Thank God!” he said,
fervently kissing a cross he drew from his bosom,
“there is a strength given to us in the hour of need,
which bears us up against every danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speaker suddenly started, ceased, and looked
around. The bolt of his door was being withdrawn
from the outside. Could it be that his jailor was
about to visit him at this hour? Slowly the massy
door swung on its hinges, and a burst of light,
streaming into the cell, for a moment dazzled the
eyes of the captive; but when he grew accustomed
gradually to the glare, he started, with even greater
surprise, to behold, not his jailor, but a maiden,
richly attired in the Oriental dress. For an instant
the young knight looked amazed, as if he beheld a
being of another world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christian!” said the apparition, using the mongrel
tongue, then adopted by both Saracens and
Franks in their communications, but speaking in a
low, sweet voice, which, melting from the maiden’s
tongue, made every word seem musical, “do you
die to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If God wills it,” said the young knight firmly,
“but what mean you?—why are you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am here to save you,” said the maiden, fixing
her eye upon his, “that is,” and she paused and
blushed in embarrassment, “if you will comply with
my conditions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young knight, who had eagerly started forward
at the first part of her sentence, now recoiled,
and with a firm voice, though one gentler than he
would have used to aught less fair, exclaimed,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you too been sent to tempt me? But
go to those from whom you came, and tell them
that Brian de Guiscan, will meet the stake rejoicing,
sooner than purchase life by abjuring his God—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wrong—you wrong me,” hastily interposed
the maiden, “I come not to ask you to
desert your God, but to tell you that I also would
be a Christian. Listen,—for my story must be
short—my nurse was a Christian captive, and from
her I learned to love your Saviour. I have long
sought to learn more of your religion, and I am
come now,” and again she blushed in embarrassment,
“to free you, sir knight, if you will conduct
me to your own land. I am the daughter of the
Emir; I have stolen his signet, and thus obtained
the keys to your cell—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is enough, fair princess, my more than deliverer,”
said the knight eagerly, “gladly will I sell
my life in your defence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist!” said the maiden in a whisper, placing
her finger on her lips, “if we speak above a murmur
we shall, perhaps be overhead—follow me,”
and turning around, she passed swiftly through the
door, and extinguishing her light, looked around to
see if she was followed, and flitted into a dark alley
of overhanging trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who can describe the emotions of de Guiscan’s
bosom, as he traversed the garden after his guide?
His release had been so sudden that it seemed like
a dream, and he placed his hand upon his brow as
if to assure himself of the reality of the passing
scene. Nor were the sensations, which he experienced,
less mixed than tumultuous. But over
every other feeling, one was predominant—the determination
to perish rather than to be re-taken, or,
least of all, to suffer a hair of his fair rescuer’s head
to be injured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their noiseless, but rapid flight toward the lower
end of the garden, and thence through a postern
gate into the fields beyond, was soon completed,—and
it was only when, arriving at a clump of palms,
beneath which three steeds, and a male attendant,
could be seen, as if awaiting them, that the maid
broke silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mount, Christian,” she said in her sweet voice,
now trembling with excitement; and then turning
toward her father’s towers, she looked mournfully
at them a moment, and de Guiscan saw, by the starlight,
that she wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes, however, they were mounted;
and so complete had been the maiden’s preparations,
that de Guiscan’s own horse, lance, and buckler,
had been provided for him. But on whom would
suspicion be less likely to rest than on the Emir’s
daughter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>They galloped long and swiftly through that
night, and just as morning began to break across
the hills of Syria, they turned aside into a thick
grove, and, dismounting, sought rest. The attendant
tied the foaming steeds a short distance apart, and,
for the first time, the princess and de Guiscan were
alone since his escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair princess,” said the young knight, “how
shall I ever show my gratitude to you? By what
name may I call my deliverer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zelma!” said the maiden modestly, dropping
her eyes before those of the knight, and speaking
with a certain tremulousness of tone that was more
eloquent than words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zelma!” said de Guiscan astonished, “and do
I indeed behold the far-famed daughter of the Emir,
Abel-dek, she for whom the Saracenic chivalry have
broken so many lances? Thou art indeed beautiful,
far more beautiful than I had dreamed. The
blessed saints may be praised, that thou wishest
to be a Christian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such is my wish,” said the maiden meekly, as
if desiring to change the conversation from her late
act, “and I pray that, as soon as may be, we may
reach some Christian outpost, where you will place
me in charge of one of those holy women, of whom
I have heard my nurse so often speak; and after
that, the only favor I ask of you, sir knight, is, that,
should you ever meet my father, Abel-dek, in battle,
you will avoid him, for his daughter’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is granted, sweet Zelma,” said de Guiscan
enthusiastically. But the attendant now returning,
their conversation was closed for the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why was it that de Guiscan, instead of retiring
to rest, when, having formed a rude couch for
Zelma, he persuaded her to take a short repose,
kept guard for hours, busy with his own thoughts,
but without uttering a word? Was it solely gratitude
to the fair Saracen which forbid him to trust
her safety even for a moment to her attendant, or
had another and deeper feeling, arising partly from
gratitude, and partly from a tenderer source, taken
possession of his soul? Certain it is, that though
the young knight had gazed on the bright eyes of his
own Gascony, and seen even the fair-haired maidens
of England, yet never had he experienced toward
any of them, such feelings as that which he now
experienced toward Zelma. Hour after hour passed
away, and still he stood watching over her slumbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the afternoon when the little party
again set forth on their flight. De Guiscan, when
the road permitted it, was ever at the bridle reins of
Zelma, and though his keen eye often swept anxiously
around the landscape, their conversation soon
grew deeply interesting, if we may judge by the
stolen glances and heightened color of Zelma, and
the eager attention with which the young knight
listened to the few words which dropped from her
lips. How had their demeanor changed since the
night before! Then the princess was all energy,
now she was the startled girl again. Then de
Guiscan followed powerless as she led, now he it
was upon whom the little party leaned for guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pursuit, the saints be praised, must long since
have ceased,” said de Guiscan, “for yonder is the
last hill hiding us from the Christian camp. When
we gain that we shall be able to see, though still
distant, the tents of my race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the maiden sparkled, and giving the
reins to their steeds, they soon gained the ascent.
The scene that burst upon them was so grand and
imposing that, involuntarily, for a moment, they
drew in and paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before them stretched out an extensive plain,
bounded on three sides by chains of hills, while on
the fourth, and western border, glistened far away
the waters of the Mediterranean. Rich fields of
waving green; sparkling rivers, now lost and now
emerging to sight; rolling uplands, crowned with
cedar forests; and, dimly seen in the distance, a
long line of glittering light, reflected from the armor
of the Crusaders, and telling where lay the Christian
camp, opened out before the eyes of the fugitives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The camp—the camp,” said de Guiscan joyously,
pointing to the far-off line of tents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden turned her eyes to behold the glittering
sight, gazed at it a moment in silence, and then
casting a look backward, in the direction of her
father’s house, she heaved a deep sigh, and said
calmly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had we not better proceed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my halidome, yes!” said de Guiscan with
sudden energy, “see yon troop of Saracens pricking
up the mountain side in our rear—here—in a line
with that cedar—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see them,” said Zelma, breathlessly, “they
are part of the Emir’s guard—they are in pursuit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On—on,” was the only answer of the young
knight, as he struck the Arabian on which the
maiden rode, and plunged his spurs deep into his
horse’s flanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had not been in motion long before they
beheld their pursuers, approaching, better mounted
than themselves, sweeping over the brow of the hill
above, in a close, dense column.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swifter—swifter, dear lady,” said the knight,
looking back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! we are beset,” suddenly said Zelma, in a
voice trembling with agitation, “see—a troop of
our pursuers are winding up the path below.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight’s eyes following the guidance of the
maiden’s trembling finger, beheld, a mile beneath
him, a large company of infidel horse, closing up
the egress of the fugitives. He paused an instant,
almost bewildered. But not a second was to be
lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does this horse path lead?” he said,
turning to the attendant, and pointing to a narrow
way, winding amongst precipitous rocks, toward
the left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It joins the greater road, some distance below.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, in God’s name let us enter it, trusting to
heaven for escape. If it comes to the worst I can
defend it against all comers, provided there is any
part of it too narrow for two to attack me abreast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are many such spots!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the saints be praised. In, in, dear lady—in
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their pace was now equally rapid until they
reached a narrow gorge, overhung by high and inaccessible
rocks, and opening behind into a wide
highway, bordering upon a plain below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here will I take my position, and await their
attack,” said de Guiscan. “How far is the nearest
Christian outpost?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A league beneath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hie, then, away to it, and tell them de Guiscan
escaped from a Saracen prison, awaits succor in this
pass. We cannot all go, else we may be overtaken.
Besides, you may be intercepted below. If you live
to reach the crusaders, I will make you rich for
life. By sundown I may expect succor if you succeed.
Till then I can hold this post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man made an Oriental obeisance, and vanished,
like lightning, down the acclivity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they come,” said de Guiscan, “they have
found us out, and are swooping like falcons from
the heights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden looked, and beheld the troop of
Saracens defiling down the mountain, one by one;
the narrowness of the path forbidding even two to
ride abreast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allah il Allah!” shouted the foremost infidel,
perceiving the knight, and galloping furiously upon
him as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a word was returned from the crusader. He
stood like a statue of steel, awaiting the onset of
the fiery Saracen. As the infidel swept on his
career, he gradually increased his distance from
his friends, until a considerable space intervened
between him and the troop of Moslems. This was
the moment for which the young knight had so anxiously
waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allah il Allah!” shouted the infidel, waving his
scimitar around his head, as he came sweeping
down upon the motionless crusader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A de Guiscan! a de Guiscan!” thundered the
knight, raising the war-cry of his fathers, as he
couched his lance, and shot like an arrow from the
pass. There was a tramp—a wild shout—a fleeting
as of a meteor—and then the two combatants
met in mid-career. Too late the infidel beheld his
error, and sought to evade that earthquake charge.
It was in vain. Horse and rider went down before
the lance of the crusader, and the last life-blood of
the Saracen had ebbed forth before de Guiscan had
even regained his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The savage cry of revenge which the companions
of the fallen man set up, would have apalled any
heart but that of de Guiscan. But he knew no fear.
The presence of Zelma, too, gave new strength to
his arm, and new energy to his soul. For more
than an hour, aided by his strong position, he kept
the whole Saracen force at bay. Every man who
attacked him went down before his lance, or fell
beneath his sword. At length, as sunset approached,
the Saracens hemming him in closer and closer,
succeeded in driving him back behind a projecting
rock, which, though it protected his person, prevented
him from doing any injury to his assailants,
who, meanwhile, were endeavoring, by climbing up
the face of the rock, to attack him from overhead.
He found that it was impossible to hold out many
moments longer. He turned to look at the maiden:
she was firm and resolved, though pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will die together,” said she, drawing closer
to his side, as if there was greater protection there
than where she had been standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! dear Zelma, for that is, I fear me, all that
is left for us to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” suddenly said the maiden, “hear you
not the clattering of horses’ feet—here—in the
rear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it be your attendant returned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—yes! it is—praised be the Christian’s
God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I vow a gold candlestick to the Holy shrine at
Jerusalem!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On, like a whirlwind, came the host of the Christians,
over the plain beneath, and through the broad
highway, until, perceiving their rescued countryman
still alive with his charge, they raised such a cry of
rejoicing that it struck terror into every Moslem’s
heart. In a few moments all danger to the fugitives
was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The infidels, now in turn retreating, were pursued
and cut off almost to a man, by a detachment of
the Christian force; while another party of the succorers
bore the rescued fugitives in triumph to the
Christian outpost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the parlor of the —— convent, at Jerusalem,
a few months later De Guiscan awaited the
appearance of Zelma. Since the day when they had
together reached the Christian outpost, he had not
beheld that beautiful Saracen, for she had seized the
first opportunity to place herself under the instruction
of the holy abbess of the —— convent at
Jerusalem. During that separation, however, de
Guiscan had thought long and ardently of his rescuer.
In the bivouac; amid the noise of a camp;
in the whirl of battle; surrounded by the beautiful
and gay; wherever, in short, he went, the young
knight had carried with him the memory of the fair
being who, at the peril of her life, had saved him
from the stake. Their hurried conversation in the
palm grove was constantly recurring to his memory.
Oh! how he wished that he might once more behold
Zelma, if only to thank her anew for his life.
But constantly occupied in the field, he had not
been at leisure to visit Jerusalem, until a summons
come from France, informing him of his father’s
death, and the necessity that he should immediately
proceed homeward, to preserve the succession to
his barony. He determined to see Zelma once
more, if only to bid her farewell forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he was swayed thus by his emotions, he heard
a light step, and looking up, he beheld the Saracen
princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zelma!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De Guiscan!” said the maiden, eagerly advancing,
but checking herself as instantly, she stood, in
beautiful embarrassment, before the knight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both felt the difficulty of their relative positions,
and both would have spoken, but could not. At
length de Guiscan said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady! I have come to thank you again for my
life, before I leave this land forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave Jerusalem—Palestine forever!” ejaculated
Zelma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bright, but long-forbidden hope lighted up the
countenance of the young knight, and perceiving
the renewed embarrassment with which the speaker
paused, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dear</span> lady! I am going to my own sunny land
far away; but I cannot depart without telling you
how deeply I love you, and that I have thought of
you, only of your sex, ever since we parted. Oh!
if not presumptious, might I hope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The still more embarrassed maiden blushed, but
she did not withdraw the hand which the young
knight had grasped. He raised and kissed it. The
next moment the trembling, but glad girl, fell weeping
on his bosom. She, too, had thought only of
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proudest family in the south of France, to
this day, trace their origin to the union of Zelma
and de Guiscan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“Ha!</span> ha! ha!” shouted Piet Albrecht, “and so
old Chriss Mienckel is going to be married at last,
and to pretty Barbara Mullerhorn, the violet of the
forest! Your gold and silver are the best suitors
after all! Give me a purse of yellow pieces before
all the rifles of the mountain. What sayest thou,
comrade,” continued he, clapping upon the back a
young man, who sat next to him, “dost thou not
think that old Mullerhorn, the gold-lover, would
have fancied thee much better, if thou hadst carried
more metal in thy pouch than upon thy shoulder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pray thee, Piet,” responded the young man,
“keep thy scurvy jests to thyself. My soul is far
too heavy for mirth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Saint Nicholas!” said Piet, “he thinks
of little Barbara! Well, courage, comrade, and
drink somewhat of this flask. Right Schiedam,
and full old, I warrant thee. What, not a drop?
Well, here’s to thee, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” said a tall, dark visaged man, attired in
a hunter’s garb, “aye! these love sick spirits are
hardly worth the trouble of enlivening. Once was
Adolf the gayest hunter in the hills; but of late, his
courage is as dull as a hare’s, and all for a green
girl, whose old schelm of a father loves his own
broad pieces too well, to bestow her upon a ranger
of the free woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace, Franz Rudenfranck,” said the youth;
“I will hear such words, not even from thee. If
old Mullerhorn continues to refuse me, I will leave
these, my native mountains, and wander in some
far distant land, hopeless and broken hearted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw,” rejoined Rudenfranck, “thou art far
too young for despair as yet. Throw thine ill-humor
to the fiend, whence it came. There are other
lasses as fair as Barbara Mullerhorn, and, by my
faith, not so difficult to obtain. Therefore, fill
comrades, let us pass a health to the recovery of
Adolf’s heart, and a more favorable issue to his
passion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the cup went gaily round, amid the shouts
of the revellers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolf Westerbok had been the gayest huntsman
of the F——g district, and the truest and merriest
lad in the mountain, until an accidental meeting
with Barbara Mullerhorn at a dance, had entirely
changed the current of his feelings. It is an old
story, and a much hackneyed one, that of love.
Let us spare the description. Suffice it to say that
Adolf and Barbara met often, and that a mutual
affection subsisted between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolf proposed himself to old Mullerhorn, and
demanded Barbara in marriage. But old Philip
Mullerhorn, a rude, churlish, and avaricious farmer,
scornfully rejected the proffer of Adolf, and forbade
him any farther interview with Barbara, alleging,
as the grounds of his disinclination, the poverty of
the hunter. Barbara was no less afflicted than
Adolf. Still, meetings between them were contrived.
At last, on the very evening, upon which
the conversation, narrated above, took place, Barbara
informed her distracted lover, that her father
had announced to her his intention of bestowing
her in marriage upon Chriss Mienckel, an elderly
widower, whose share of this world’s goods was
ample enough to attract the covetous regards of
old Philip Mullerhorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Burning with rage, and filled with tumultuous
thoughts, Adolf quitted Barbara, after bestowing
upon her a long embrace, and repaired to the inn
of the hamlet, in hopes of finding Franz Rudenfranck,
a huntsman, who had professed a singular
attachment for him, and who had signalised this
attachment by many personal proofs of friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of old Mienckel’s success had reached
the hamlet before him, and he had not been seated
many minutes, before Piet Albrecht, the professed
joker of the village, began to rally him upon the
subject. Piet had already irritated Adolf in no
small measure; but the lover had thus far concealed
his feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha!” exclaimed Piet, gaily, “to think
that the old, shrivelled widower of threescore
should outcharm the youth of twenty! If I had
been Adolf Westerbok, I don’t think that Chriss
would have carried matters so, and I should have
worn the wedding ribbon in spite of his ducats.
But there’s no accounting for tastes, eh? What
say you, comrades?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hunters laughed; and Adolf, annoyed at
length beyond endurance, rejoined in somewhat of
a surly tone; to which Piet answered more jestingly
than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence, fool!” said Rudenfranck, now interfering,
“thou hast neither wit nor manners, and I
should but serve thee rightly, did I lay my ramrod
soundly over thy shoulders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Piet shrank back abashed, for there was that
expression upon the brow of Rudenfranck that few
cared to see, and fewer to withstand. The hunters
were silent for a moment, but one of them, at last,
answered Rudenfranck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would I fain see, Franz Rudenfranck.
Keep thy ramrod for thy hound; for, by the holy
apostles, if thou layest the weight of thy finger
upon Piet, I will try whether my bullet or thy skin
proves the harder, albeit some say no lead can
harm thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace, Hans Veltenmayer,” rejoined Rudenfranck.
“If thou wert wise, which any fool may
plainly perceive thou art not, thou wouldest chain
that unruly tongue within thine ugly mouth, or keep
those threats for thy wife, who, if some say aright,
would receive them so kindly, as to repay thee, not
in words, but in heavier coin. Tush man, never
lift thy rifle at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned sharply upon the hunter, who had
seized his rifle and was levelling it toward him;
wrested it from his hand, and by a slight motion,
cast him rudely upon the ground. Veltenmayer
rose, and slunk among his laughing companions,
muttering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Adolf,” said Rudenfranck, “I know
what thou wouldst have. Leave we this merry
company, and go thou with me to my hut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left the inn, and plunged deep into the
forest.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> F——g district, as it is called, where the
scene of this legend is laid, is one of the highest
points in the great range of the Alleghany mountains.
High, broken peaks, capped with towering
pines, rise upon every side in billowy confusion;
while the loftier and more regular chains of mountains
stretch far away in every direction, fading and
sinking upon the eye, until from a rich, dark green,
they seem to meet and unite with the azure of the
sky. Rough, rocky precipices; a red and stony
soil, where the green mosses crawl and intertwist,
in confused, yet beautiful arrangement, over the
sward; thick low underwood, and forests almost
impenetrable from their density; deep ravines, and
craggy watercourses, some entirely destitute of
water, and others, gushing precipitately along,
flushed by unfailing springs, are the characteristics
of this mountain district. The rude log cabins
of the few inhabitants of this country, lie distant
and scantily scattered through the almost pathless
woods, and the entire appearance of the scenery
has a sublime, though a savage and uncultivated
air. The original settlers of this tract were Germans
and Swiss, whose descendants, even at the
present day, are almost the sole tenantry of these
hills. Their nature seems congenial to the surrounding
mountains; and the national exercise of
the rifle, the merry dance and song, and those yet
more venerable Dionysia, the apple-butter boilings,
quilting parties, and log liftings, still constitute the
favorite amusements of this primitive people. Even
their religion, a strange compound of German mysticism,
engrafted upon a plentiful stock of superstition,
seems peculiarly appropriate to their mode of
living, and their wild country. Nay, the very dress
of a century back, still holds its fashion among
these hills; and the peasant or hunter, loosely
attired in his homespun suit of brown or blue
adorned with fringe, or decked out with large,
antique, silver or pewter buttons, occasionally
garnished with the effigies of some popular saint;
his large, broad brimmed wool hat, flapped over his
face; his leather leggings; and dark, curly beard,
presents a lively image of his fathers, the original
settlers of the district. Add to this, the bright,
keen wood-knife, sheathed in its leather case, and
stuck in a broad girdle, with the powder horn and
pouch; and the unfailing rifle strapped across the
shoulder, and you have a perfect description of the
general appearance of that people, who inhabit the
F——g settlement, and the back-woods of Pennsylvania,
at the present day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudenfranck and his companion strode onward
through the woods for some time without speaking.
The elder hunter eyeing his friend keenly, at last
broke the unsocial silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need not ask of thee, Adolf, why thy brow
is clouded, and thine eye so heavy. I, myself,
although thou mayest smile at such confession
from me, have suffered long, and deeply, from a
like cause. But my tale shall not now interrupt
thy grief, and I have often thought that the very
leaves of the forest would find tongues to repeat a
story, which might move nature herself. I would
afford thee aid; not gall thy wounds by the recital
of my own. Speak; is it not thus? Thou hast
met Barbara Mullerhorn, even after her churlish
father had forbidden thy suit. I know too well,
Adolf, that the more we are opposed the brighter
burns our love. But in pursuing thus thy suit,
thou hast not done wisely. Yet I may still aid
thee, and I will do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, good Franz,” replied the youth, “this
complaint is far beyond thy remedy. Gold alone
can sway the determination of Philip Mullerhorn,
and well dost thou know that Chriss Mienckel is
the richest man in the settlement. How then
canst thou, a poor hunter like myself, afford that
aid, which wealth alone can give? No! no! I
 see nought save disappointment—save despair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou knowest but little of me, Adolf,” said
Rudenfranck, solemnly, “but thou art destined to
learn more. See, the moon is already rising
through the pines, and on this evening, the annual
recurrence of which, is fraught with dread and woe
to me; and each succeeding anniversary of which,
brings me nearer to my stern destiny, shalt thou
learn of me a secret, which, if thou hast the fearlessness
of soul to fathom, all may be well, at least
with thee. But thou canst only learn it of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rudenfranck,” said Adolf, “the hunters speak
much evil of thee, and strange tales are current
concerning thee in the settlement. Unholy things,
it is said, flit round thy hut in the hushed hour of
midnight. Unholy sounds are heard resounding
through the deep glen where thou abidest. Old
men speak warily of thee, and cross themselves as
thou passest by, and the village maidens shrink
from thy hand in the dance. These may be
idle tales; but, Rudenfranck, thy words to-night
are suspicious. Nevertheless, be thou wizard or
enchanter; be thy knowledge that of the good
saints, or of a darker world, to thee and to that
knowledge I commit myself. Thou hast proved
thy friendship, and, for weal or woe, I will trust
thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men speak not all aright,” rejoined the hunter,
while a dark shadow obscured his visage, and his
words fell as though he spake them unwillingly,
“nor say they altogether wrong.” The young
huntsman looked at Rudenfranck for a moment;
then, grasping his hand, he cried—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then thou canst aid me, Rudenfranck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will I, as I have the power,” said the
hunter; “but we are at the hut. Thy hand upon
it, that what I shall tell thee will find a grave in
thy breast. Else I will not, I cannot assist thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My hand upon it,” replied Adolf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enter then,” said the hunter, “let fear be a
stranger to thy breast, and all shall yet be well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they entered the cottage, a shadowy form
flitted past the door, and the wind sighed mournfully
through the forest.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> hut of Rudenfranck differed but little in appearance
from the ordinary dwellings of the settlers
of the district. Large pine logs, piled rudely together,
and cemented with mud, in order to exclude
the wind from the chinks, composed the cabin.
Two or three common chairs, a pine table, and a
camp bed, with a few culinary utensils, constituted
the entire furniture of the hunter’s hut. A torch of
resinous wood, which flared from an iron bracket,
gave light to the room, and a large fire soon occupied
the wide hearth. A few articles of sylvan
warfare hung round the cabin; and on a shelf,
some pewter mugs and earthen dishes, a pair of
stag’s antlers, and two or three old folios, their
ponderous covers clasped together with silver
clenches, lay exposed. A large, rawboned dog,
rough of coat, and muscular of form, whose fine
muzzle and bright eye, spoke of rare blood, was
extended before the hearth. Roused by the noise
made by Rudenfranck and his companion in entering,
he sprang up, erected his bristles, and uttered a
low growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down, Fritz, be quiet,” said Rudenfranck, as
the dog, recognising his master, fawned upon him;
“welcome to my poor hut, Adolf. I can give
thee no better cheer than our coarse mountain fare
will afford, although I may assist thee in some
other important matters. Come, draw thy chair
to the fire, man. The wind is somewhat sharp
to-night, and I will endeavor to make out some
refreshment for thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He retired for a moment, and entered again,
bearing a noble supply of fat venison, which he
immediately set about preparing for their supper.
The rich steam of the savory steaks soon attracted
the attention of Fritz, who, stretched out before the
fire with lion-like gravity, inhaled their genial flavor
with manifest symptoms of approbation. Rudenfranck’s
preparations were soon completed, and,
producing a curious green flask, and two tall silver
cups from a recess, he invited Adolf, by precept and
example, to partake of the viands set before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the spirit of Adolf was too heavy for feasting,
and the morsel lay untasted on the trencher
before him. Rudenfranck himself, although he
pressed Adolf to eat, neglected his meal, and the
table was speedily cleared, Fritz being accommodated
with the relics of the repast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taste this wine,” said Rudenfranck, “although
myself no great lover of the grape, I am somewhat
curious in my choice of wines, and may indulge my
little vanity so far as to quaff the juice I drink, out
of a more costly metal than falls to the lot of most
gay hunters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly, Rudenfranck,” replied Adolf, “thy promised
plans for the relief of my unfortunate condition
seem to have escaped thy memory. For rather
would I hearken to them, than drink thy wine, even
from a silver cup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so, Adolf,” said the hunter, “I will now
fulfil my promise to thee. But first, the secret of
my power to aid thee, and the means by which this
assistance may be rendered, must be explained to
thee. Listen, then, and regard not my countenance
but my words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have heard the elders of the hamlet speak
of Count Theodore Falkenhelm, a renowned noble
of Alsace, in Germany. This Falkenhelm was
known to have sailed from Germany, with many
other settlers for America. Few knew his reasons
for quitting his native country, for he was a dark,
unsocial man, and some have said that he had
dealings with the Spirit of Evil. He had not been
resident here for a long time, before it was observed
that he became averse to society, cautious of remark,
and jealous of scrutiny. The spot in which
he had fixed his abode, was visited by few footsteps,
for his mood was fierce, and his society, at times,
was dangerous. It was concluded that he was insane.
But it was not so. Mark me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A youth, some five years after the count had
taken his dwelling in these mountains, arrived here
from Germany. He had not long ranged these
woods, before the fame of the count inspired him
with a boyish curiosity to see and to know him.
An opportunity was soon afforded; for returning
one evening, wearied with the chase, a thunder
storm and night overtook him near the cottage
of the count. He demanded hospitality, and was
admitted, though reluctantly. What he saw that
night, when all was hushed in the death of sleep,
he never told to mortal; but he raved wildly of
fiends and phantoms, and died, soon after, a maniac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shortly after this event, the count disappeared,
nor has since been heard of here. But many succeeding
years brought news of a dismal tragedy
in Germany, and from the account of him who
brought the report, it was supposed by those who
remembered the count, that he was the principal
actor in the scene of blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hut which the recluse had deserted, was
the source of continual dread to the superstitious
peasants, whose fears had magnified the ruinous
cabin into a palace, where the revels of the great
fiend were held. But one, whose heart was bolder,
and who had lately arrived in the settlement, took
possession of the hut, repaired it, and there fixed his
abode. That man, Adolf Westerbok, stands before
you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not always been what I now appear.
I was well born, although poor, and had served in
my country’s battles, not without reputation. I
loved the daughter of a baron, of high family and
large estates, whose castle, on the Aar, stood near
the dwelling of my father. Thy tale of love is
mine, thus far. Although loved in return, and
loving—O! spirit of my injured Thekla!—deeper,
far deeper than mortal, whose blood burned not
like mine, could love; she was torn from me—me,
who would have died for her; whose only aim in
life was to approve myself worthy of her—and
whose love was mine alone—torn from me, and
dragged, an unwilling, wretched sacrifice, to the
castle of a rich nobleman of our country. Here,
her tears and visible decay, instead of moving compassion
in the heart of her husband, rendered him
jealous and morose. On one occasion, he struck
her to the earth in furious rage—struck her, do you
mark me?—aye, inflicted a blow on that fair breast
which I would have braved hell to defend! It
caused her death, for she was pregnant—she died
that day. I—yon insulted heaven knows how
deeply!—I avenged her, and the steel which
struck the life blow to his heart, never has been,
and never shall be cleansed. Look at it—I keep
it as a memorial of most holy revenge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudenfranck drew from his vest a broad, sharp
dagger, and threw it on the table before Adolf, who
saw with horror that the blade and hilt were encrusted
with the stains of long-spilled blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was forced to quit Germany, and wandered
through Spain an aimless, hopeless man. Here I
became acquainted with Count Falkenhelm. He was
in danger from the Inquisition, and I aided his escape
from their toils. A hater of mankind, naught,
save the knowledge of how bitter an enmity Falkenhelm
bore to it, prompted me to rescue him from
the snare. A murder was committed in Alsace.
Letters came to me from Falkenhelm, desiring me
to hasten to him, and ere he met the inevitable
doom of his crime, to receive a last legacy which
he wished to bequeath me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hastened to him, and on the night ere he
was executed, he imparted to me this secret: that,
deep within these forests, the mighty treasures of
a long buried sage and necromancer, whose power
could control the elements, and the spirits of
fire, lay hidden. These were the treasures of
Bructorix, borne from Germany by magic spells.
They were guarded by potent spirits of hell. To
me did he commit this knowledge, together with
those books, at which you have often wondered,
and this spell, which commands the world of demons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, he again went to the recess, drew
forth a small gold box, and opening it with reverence,
displayed a fair linen cloth, folded in such a
manner as to present five angles, at equal distances,
in the centre of which was fixed an opal, of immense
value, upon which certain mysterious letters were
engraved. The letters which formed the spell,
glistened and flashed as though with internal fires,
as the light fell upon the polished jewel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” said Rudenfranck, closing the box, “is
the magic pentagon, the key to the treasures of
King Bructorix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens!” cried Adolf, “you received, then,
this most fatal gift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did; and took upon myself an awful penalty.
I said, ‘Ambition! thou shalt be my God, for love
is lost to me!’ I came on to this country immediately
after the execution of the count, and have
discovered the treasure. Reasons, unimportant for
you to know, have detained me here some years,
disguised as the hunter Rudenfranck. This is the
point, then. You cannot obtain Barbara Mullerhorn
without gold; nor dare I, if I could, bestow this
treasure upon you. You must follow my example,
and call upon the spirit of Bructorix yourself. I
will instruct you in the manner, but you must undertake
the adventure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the penalty you spoke of,” said Adolf,
trembling, as the hot eyes of Rudenfranck glared
upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot tell you. The spirit proposes different
sacrifices. Mine is—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A loud gust of wind interrupted the speaker, and
Adolf shuddered, as he fancied he could distinguish
the flapping of pinions through the blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” said Rudenfranck, breathing hard, and
speaking low,—“I had forgot!—I had forgot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this thy plan?” said Adolf, “I fear me it is
unhallowed. I will begone and pray to be delivered
from the evil one. Rudenfranck, I will not accept
of such assistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy life upon it,” said the hunter, “if thou
betrayest me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have given my hand to secresy, and yet—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Choose well and warily, Adolf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will I, Rudenfranck. There can be no
sin, I trust, in hearing so unholy a tale. Is this the
only plan—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the only one. But, away, if thou canst
not accept this aid. I can give thee no other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Adolf, as he turned slowly to
leave the hut, “I am ruined and desperate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, go,” said Rudenfranck bitterly, looking
after the retreating form of Adolf, with a fiendish
sneer, “go, fool! Thus is it ever with that microcosm
of folly, man. Aye, I can plainly see that
the treasure of King Bructorix will soon acquire a
new guardian. Another victim, and I leave these
fatal shores, and forever.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> Adolf returned homeward, many and various
were the contending reflections which embittered
his mind. At one time he thought of the misery
which he must endure in beholding the object of his
dearest affections, united to Mienckel, her profound
aversion; now, vague dreams of the wealth and
happiness which the possession of the hidden treasure
would confer upon him, flitted across his mind;
but a chill damp struck through his soul as he remembered
the intimated penalty; and wild imaginations
of spectral forms, demoniac faces, and the
awful legendary tales, so current among the peasantry,
filled his breast with horror. He reached his cottage,
and threw himself upon his humble couch, agonised
by conflicting emotions. No sleep visited his pillow,
and early the next morning he arose and went
forth, hoping to subdue the fever of his blood by
exercise in the cold air. He wandered about for
some time, listless in which direction he took his
way, until he found himself near the farm house of
old Mullerhorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a jolly day at the house of that ancient.
Turkeys, geese, pigs, and the promiscuous tenantry
of the barn yard, bled beneath the knives of the rosy
Dutch damsels. The smoke curled in copious
volumes from the ample chimneys, and the hissing
of culinary utensils, employed at the genial occupation
of preparing divers dainties, together with the
savory odors from the purlieus of the kitchen, gave
indisputable tokens that something highly important
was taking place in the house. Adolf viewed this
busy scene with melancholy feelings enough, for he
well presaged what it meaned. He paused, and
leaned sadly on his rifle; but his heart felt still
heavier, when, from a window of the farm house a
fair white hand was extended, waving a handkerchief
toward him. A tear stole down his cheek, as he
acknowledged the signal, and, raising his rifle, was
about to depart, when a slight tap on the shoulder
arrested him, and a plump little maiden, whose rosy
cheeks, and smiling face, were the very emblems of
good humor, in fact, a perfect Dutch Hebe, accosted
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how now, master Adolf? Have you not
a word for an old acquaintance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Agatha, is it thou? How dost thou, my
good lass?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, Adolf, than either yourself or Barbara,
if there is any judgment in your looks. Why, you
look as if you had seen a spectre, and if you will
keep company with that black-looking wretch, that
Franz Rudenfranck, I wouldn’t insure that you
will not see one, some of these dark nights. Bless
me, how you change color. Are you sick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Agatha. Not so sick in body as in
heart. How fares Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, indeed, Dolf, for I will call you Dolf
again, and it’s a shame for father Philip to make
us all call you master Adolf; master indeed! she
has done nothing but cry all night. But she is to
be married to old Chriss this morning—the odious
fool! I’m sure she hates him—and I’ve a thousand
things to do; so good bye to you Dolf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lively little girl ran off, and Adolf again was
about to pursue his path, when old Mullerhorn,
accompanied by the intended bridegroom, and some
of his neighbors, arrived at the farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, Adolf,” said the old man, while a cynical
smile played over his thin features, “Adolf here.
Thou hast been a stranger of late, lad. But, come,
wilt thou not in with us and witness this merry
marriage? In faith, it will gladden my little Barbara
to see thee there. Come, thou must aid in
this gay ceremony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolf was, for a moment, undecided what answer
to make old Mullerhorn; but curbing his indignation,
and repressing an angry reply—he thought it
most prudent to accept the invitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, neighbor Philip,” said he, “and
willingly will go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that is well spoken, boy,” replied the
old man, unusually elated by the occasion. “I
always liked thee, Adolf; but no ducats, lad, no
ducats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not so very difficult to procure,”
whispered a voice in Adolf’s ear; he turned, and
beheld Rudenfranck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, in, Adolf; and eh? Franz Rudenfranck
too? But, in—in with ye both,” said old Mullerhorn,
and the party entered the farm-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room into which they were ushered, was an
ample, commodious apartment, constructed in the
true Dutch fashion, with a polished oak floor, and
noble rafters of the same wood. It was hung
around with some few gay colored prints, illustrating
Scripture subjects, and some bright tin sconces;
and the furniture was substantial, although homely.
A large mahogany press, whose bright surface and
polished brass knobs, might have compared in brilliancy
with the mirror, stood in one corner; an old
fashioned Indian chest, ponderous and highly japanned,
ornamented the opposite niche. Some heavy
chairs with long, high backs, and formal arms and
legs; the never failing spinning wheel and Dutch
clock; and a pair of tall, ill-shaped, brass fire-dogs,
completed the garniture of the apartment. The
walls were decorated with festoons of evergreen,
tastefully arranged by the fair hands of Barbara
herself. Two ill-looking, dingy paintings, also occupied
a couple of recesses; and a neatly polished
cherry table, near a window, displayed an inviting
array of apple brandy, cherry wine, cider, and such
refreshments as were indigenous to the country.
The good dame, after welcoming kindly her guests,
bustled off to resume the superintendence of the
kitchen; and the unfortunate Barbara herself, arrayed
in bridal trim, and looking through her tears,
as lovely as the violet, freshly bathed in dew, remained,
seated in one of the large chairs, and
vainly endeavoring to conceal her emotion. As
Adolf entered, her heart palpitated violently, and
she could with difficulty so far command herself,
as to bid him welcome. Nor did the sight of Barbara
in such distress, fail equally to afflict her lover;
a grief which Rudenfranck artfully increased, by
hinting strongly to Adolf, the possibility of changing
the entire face of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The magistrate having arrived, and matters being
so arranged as to bring the affiance to a conclusion,
Rudenfranck took the opportunity to lead Adolf
apart from the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou thrice sodden ass,” said he, “can’st thou
call thyself a lover, and yet allow so much innocence
and beauty to be sacrificed to age and avarice?
Say thou the word; promise to obey me,
and thou shalt yet possess her. See, they are about
to sign. Hesitate a moment longer—and look,
Barbara implores thee—she is lost. Farewell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay,” rejoined Adolf, hurriedly, “this must
not—shall not be. Rudenfranck, I promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, demand of old Mullerhorn that the ceremony
be delayed, and leave the rest to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Philip,” said Adolf, addressing Mullerhorn,
who was just about to affix his name to the
deed, “you are aware how long and how truly I
have loved Barbara. To see her thus sacrificed, is
more than I can bear, and I entreat you to consider
farther upon this matter, and to defer this marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guests looked utterly confounded. Chriss
Mienckel opened wide his large, gray eyes, and
stared upon the bold hunter in profound amazement.
Barbara turned red and pale by turns; and old Mullerhorn
crimsoned with rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I not told ye, Adolf Westerbok, that I
would never bestow Barbara upon a beggarly hunter?
What devil then, prompts thee to interrupt a
match which thou hast no power to prevent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest father,” said Barbara, clasping the hard
hand of the old man, “hearken to Adolf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away, idle girl! Adolf, tempt me not to do
thee an injury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay,” said the hunter, “is it even so? Well,
then; gold for gold—ducat for ducat—nay, double
each ducat that old Mienckel can bestow, will I lay
before you, Philip Mullerhorn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy morning draught has been somewhat of
the strongest, Adolf. Where should’st thou have
met with these sums?” Chriss Mienckel chuckled
portentously, and thrusting each hand into his capacious
pockets, a melodious harmony of jingling
coins soon resounded from their precincts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look in thy pouch,” whispered Rudenfranck.
Adolf did so, and drew forth two purses, richly furnished
with gold. Astonishment fairly stupified the
guests; and the covetous eyes of old Mullerhorn
glistened at the sight of money. But the recollection
of Mienckel’s broad lands and fair cattle crossed
his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gold for gold,” said he, musingly. “Well,
well, it may be so; and Adolf, when thou canst
certify me concerning these riches, thou shalt,
perhaps, find me not altogether opposed to thee.
This ceremony, for the present, with the consent of
Mienckel, shall be postponed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mienckel nodded his assent; for he was a man
of but few words. But Adolf, holding the hand of
Barbara, demanded an immediate trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so, then,” replied Mullerhorn. “My
neighbor’s property is well known. Let it be thy
task to prove thy fortune equal to his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mienckel, “house and farm—cattle
and gear—broad lands—rich farming ground—bright
ducats——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To balance which, I throw, as earnest, these
purses,” said Adolf. “Rudenfranck, can’st thou
not aid me now?” whispered he, turning to the
hunter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now,” rejoined Rudenfranck, “you have
the last of my gold. To-night——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night!” said Adolf, impatiently, “an age!
Father Philip, I pledge myself that on the morrow
I will prove myself worthy your regard in purse as
well as in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agreed,” said Mullerhorn, “until to-morrow let
the espousal be deferred. If thou can’st then satisfy
my doubts, Barbara shall be thine. If not, this
marriage shall no longer be prevented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, father, and farewell. Come thou with
me, Rudenfranck. Ere to-morrow night, sweet Barbara,
all shall be accomplished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudenfranck and Adolf left the house, and
walked through the forest in the direction of the
hut of Rudenfranck. Few words were exchanged
between them, until, being arrived at the hut,
they closed the door carefully, and Adolf broke
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Rudenfranck,” said he, “I must know
the means by which this treasure may be discovered.
Speak then, and quickly. I promise obedience in
all matters, faithfully and truly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” replied Rudenfranck, “it is thus. Meet
me to-night, as the moon casts a straight shadow
over the range of the Wolf Hills. You know the
dark cavern by the run, where, it is said, that old
Schwearenheim was carried off bodily, by the Evil
One——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a fearful place, and a fearful hour,” said
Adolf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool, thou hast gone too far to recede. Only
hint at doing so, and, by all the fiends of hell, I
withdraw every hope of my assistance from thee.
Wilt thou excite the expectations of Barbara, only
to dash them again to the earth? Wilt thou thus
vacillate, until it becomes too late to save her from
Mienckel? If thou dost so, thou art the veriest
driveller that wears man’s attire. Mark me, and
answer not. Meet me there, at the cave, when the
midnight hour arrives; and hark thee, thou must
procure a wafer of the consecrated host. Bring
thy rifle with thee, and leave the rest to my care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so,” said Adolf, “it is too late to recede.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See that thou fail not,” said Rudenfranck,
“and now promise to Mullerhorn what thou wilt.
Keep thou but faith with me, and thou shalt enjoy
all that thou hast ever hoped for. Be not seen with
me to-day. Go to the village. Look cheerily;
procure that which I have directed thee, and fail
not at midnight.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> shades of evening were gradually enveloping
the country in darkness, as Adolf and Barbara sat
together, in the mansion of the Mullerhorns. They
spoke of love and happier times, and the bright eyes
of the maiden beamed joyously upon the countenance
of the youth. Adolf had learned the art of
dissimulation in a brief space of time. Alas! it is
but the first step in evil that alarms, and he, that
has abandoned the paths of virtue, but for a moment,
finds it far more difficult to retrace his steps,
than to continue in the ways of error. To the
enquiries of Barbara, concerning the wealth which
he had so lately acquired, he replied, that the death
of a relation, whose property was ample, had enabled
him to compete, in point of riches, even with
Christopher Mienckel. Barbara fully believed him;
for true love is ever ready of faith; and fondly
pictured to herself many a scene of happiness and
of domestic felicity. Thus the evening wore on;
and the hunter was startled to hear the hour of ten
strike from the clock, as he arose to quit the society
of Barbara, and to join the companion of his unhallowed
undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whither away to-night, and so early, Adolf?”
asked Barbara, as the hunter made ready to depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have shot a buck in the forest, and must seek
aid to bring him in,” replied Adolf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is full late to seek your game in the broad
forest to-night, Adolf,” said Piet Albrecht, who had
been solacing himself with a dish of discourse with
Agatha, in the kitchen, and now came to bid Barbara
good night. “Yet, if you would wish my
help, to show you that I have forgotten our difference,
I don’t care if I go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank thee, Piet,” replied the young man,
“but the game lies far off, and Franz Rudenfranck
has promised to go with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you left it?” asked Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deep in the forest; near the Wolf Hills. At
the cave of Schwearenheim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not,” said Piet, shuddering, “what
could tempt me to go there, so near midnight. It
will be nearly that, Adolf, when you reach there,
and the cave is, the saints be good to us, an unholy
spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw, Piet, this is mere superstition,” said the
hunter; but his cheek glowed, and his flesh trembled.
“Why should the cave be a more unholy
spot than any other part of the forest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know as well as I do, Adolf, that few of
the hunters have the courage to pass there after
dark. My father has told me awful things of the
place, and one of them happened to himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that, pray, Piet?” said Agatha, “did
he tumble into the run, and fancy that the water
was Schiedam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of the sort, Mistress Agatha,” responded
Piet. “You must know that my father
was a woodsman, as bold as any man among the
hills. He happened to be late out one evening,
after game; and had chased a large mountain cat
to the run, where the cat climbed up an old hollow
tree. My father followed him closely, and mounted
after him; but his hold gave way, as he was looking
down the hollow, and he slipped clear through
the hole, good forty feet down the inside of the
tree. Well, he thought that his hour was come,
and that he should starve to death there; for the
inside of the tree was so smooth that he could get
no hold for either hand or foot; and so he had lost
all hope of ever escaping, when he saw something
black come sliding down the tree. He recommended
himself to God, and when the thing, whatever
it was, came within reach, he seized hold of
it, and it climbed up again, dragging my father
after it. It had no sooner reached the top of the
tree; but a loud clap of thunder was heard, and the
thing sailed away in a flame of fire, far away over
the tree tops. My father clung fast to the trunk of
the tree, and slid down the outside, after he had
clambered out of the hollow; then thanking Providence
for his deliverance, he went home as fast as
his legs could carry him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wonderful tale, indeed, Piet,” said Agatha,
laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful enough,” said Piet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Piet,” said Adolf, “was this truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truth!” replied Piet, “I should like to have
heard any man tell my father that it was otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not go to-night, dearest Adolf,” said Barbara,
turning pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is mere folly, sweet Barbara. If I failed
to bring home my buck, all the hunters would cry
shame upon me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clock struck the half hour, and Adolf,
snatching up his rifle, bade Barbara good night,
and leaving the house, struck into the path which
led to the Wolf Hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye,” said Piet, looking after him, “he
doesn’t believe in any such matters; but I fear it
is no good that he is bent upon. So much gold,
too, and so lately. But it’s no affair of mine.
Did you mark the wildness of his eye, though,
Agatha?”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> moon shone brightly and calmly over the
still woods, and the gentle breath of the night wind
sighed mournfully over the ear, as it kissed the
forest branches, and swept through the tops of the
pines. The murmur of the stream, as it flowed
smoothly onward between the high mountain passes,
added to the soft influence of the scene. All nature
was lulled into repose. A small charcoal fire, burning
on a rocky ledge, beneath a tall cliff, disclosed
the mouth of a dark cavern, at the entrance of
which sat Rudenfranck, the hunter, wrapped in a
cloak, to protect his person from the heavy damps
of the night. He rose from his seat, and moved
restlessly about, making some arrangements in the
mouth of the cavern, and occasionally casting an
anxious glance over the surrounding hills, as if impatiently
expecting his victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that he will hardly fail me,” muttered
he. “No, he has too much at stake to abandon
this enterprise. How still the night is! Strange,
that he comes not, and yet the hour approaches
rapidly. All is prosperous thus far. O, star of my
destiny, triumph in this hour, which is doomed to
complete the anxious toil of years! Rejoice in the
anticipated majesty of high dominion! But why
do I feel so sad? What small voice is that, which
whispers me to desist from my undertaking? Repentance—repentance!
My spirit is too dark, and
I could not, if I would, repent. How quickly my
heart beats as the time speeds on! Yet one more
victim! Why, I shall be a king? that word is too
weak, to express the glorious extent of wisdom and
power which I shall enjoy. But happiness—no,
no!—that feeling I shall never more experience!
These thoughts—the recollection of past crime.
Why should I think of crime, who am beyond the
hope of salvation? Ha! he comes! ’Twas but
the plash of an otter. No! he is here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rudenfranck, is it thou?” said Adolf, “lend
me thy hand. So. I have met with strange warnings
in my path toward thee. I fear to go on.
Can nothing be devised save this dread trial?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already told thee, nothing. Come up.
The air is damp, and my fire burns brightly. Have
you procured that which I desired of thee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it; but, Rudenfranck, sacrilege was the
price of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never regard the price, so as thou hast it.
This is right,” said the hunter, as he received the
consecrated wafer. “Help me to build this pile,
which must be raised before we commence our
solemn work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolf assisted Rudenfranck to build a small pile
of stones, upon which were deposited the box containing
the pentagon, the consecrated wafer, and
a small cruse, in which was a dark red liquid.
Rudenfranck also placed a brazier on the pile, into
which he deposited some slips of parchment, inscribed
with talismanic characters. As they finished
their task, the moon cast a straight and gigantic
shadow across the Wolf Hills, and the pines seemed
to dilate, in the white glare, to an unearthly size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the hour,” said Rudenfranck. “Be firm.
Shrink not; and expect the full reward of thy
bravery. Help me to don these vestments.” He
threw across his shoulders a furred robe, which he
bound tightly round his body with a broad, red
girdle. He then placed on his head a conical cap,
and taking in his hand a sword, inscribed with characters,
and without a guard, he described on the
earth, the form of a pentagon, the centre of the
figure being occupied by the altar stones, at the
side of which Rudenfranck placed his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lay thine hand on the altar,” said Rudenfranck,
“and pour from this cruse into the brazier, the
liquid which it contains. Stay not to look around
thee, but feed the fire steadily, while I perform our
magic ceremonies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudenfranck lit a fire in the brazier as he spoke,
and drawing a dagger from his girdle, plunged it
violently into his arm. The blood flowed freely.
He allowed it to run upon the five angles, reciting
in a strange language, mysterious charms. He
then placed the linen pentagon in front of his
breast, and commanded Adolf to feed the flame as
he had instructed him. Adolf poured the liquid
from the cruse into the burning brazier; and Rudenfranck,
gradually raising his voice, until from a
measured chaunt, he broke into furious vehemence,
suddenly pronounced the charm of the opal. The
moon, which had till now shone brightly, changed
its color to a deep red; thunder rolled, and the
forked lightning flashed frequently and fearfully.
The stars shot wildly across the face of heaven.
The wind whistled and groaned through the trees.
The earth quaked; and the whole frame of nature
seemed to shudder at the incantation. A furious
crash resounded through the cavern; brilliant lights
danced through the gloom; the magic words engraved
on the opal gave out a dense and aromatic
smoke, and the entire body of rock, seeming to split
asunder, with a tremendous crash, disclosed a magnificent
brazen gate, ornamented with characters
similar to those on the opal, at the sides of which
two gigantic skeletons, crowned with diadems, and
bearing strange weapons in their bony grasp, stood,
the grisly warders of the charmed treasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudenfranck paused from his incantations, and,
turning to Adolf, said in a hoarse whisper,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the portal which encloses the treasures
of Bructorix; but the phantom of the sage must
now be invoked. Take thou this holy wafer, and
affix it to yon brazen gate. Do this speedily, and
fear not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolf, highly excited and bewildered by the
scene, obeyed without hesitation. Once, as he
was about to affix the consecrated element to the
gate, he fancied that some invisible arm endeavored
to restrain his hand; but he performed the
commands of Rudenfranck, and returned to the
altar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Rudenfranck, “but one more thing
remains for thee to perform. Raise thy rifle; take
good aim, and shoot at the wafer of the host.
Shoot bravely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wretched and abandoned Adolf followed the
instructions of Rudenfranck. He raised his rifle,
took deliberate aim at the holy emblem, and fired.
A demoniac shout rang through the cave. The
angles of the pentagon shot forth vivid lightnings.
The skeleton guardians of the gate threw down
their weapons, while red light flamed from their
eyeless skulls. The massive leaves of the gate flew
wide open, and displayed an immense vault, filled
with huge vases of gold and jewels, which shone
with ineffable brilliance. The arched and fretted
roof was sustained by bronze pillars, representing
strange and hideous animals, contorted into the
most grotesque attitudes. Thousands of gnomes,
swarmed through the vault, of misshapen forms,
whose fierce and raging eyes dwelt upon the hunters,
with anger and contempt. Thrice did Rudenfranck,
bowing himself to the earth, call upon the
name of Bructorix. Thrice hollow thunder pealed
throughout the cavern, and, at the third appeal, a
gigantic figure rose slowly through the earth, and
stood before them. The figure was enveloped in
an imperial robe of purple, embroidered with jewels,
precious beyond description. A girdle of living fire
encircled his waist, and a crown of various and
brilliant gems bound his white and flowing locks.
In his hand he carried an ivory sceptre. His countenance,
scathed by flames, looked like that of some
ghastly denizen of the tomb, newly raised to-day;
and its expression was lofty, haughty and commanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who calls upon the name of Bructorix?” asked
the spectre, in a sepulchral voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The seeker of his power, mighty spirit,” answered
Rudenfranck. “I bring to thee the promised
victim, and expect the reward of my services.
Once more prolong the date of my life, and execute
those promises made me; when by mighty spells,
I had raised thee from the abode of the dead, in
Germany. That term expired, I bring unto thee
another soul, or else resign my own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would this youth enjoy my treasures,” asked
the phantom, “and knows he the nature of the
obligation I demand of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He asks wealth of thee, and, in return, will accede
to thy demands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him sign the deed, which gives over to my
master his soul and body, and his wishes shall be
gratified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudenfranck drew from his breast a parchment
scroll, and the infatuated Adolf, with his own blood,
subscribed to his eternal ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take of my treasures,” said the sceptre, “what
thou would’st have, and use it as thou wilt. In
exchange for the gift of thy soul, contained in this
writing, thou shalt have full access to my treasure.
But, mark me. Seven years are granted unto thee,
at the close of which time, thou must return, and
pay thy homage to the lord of these realms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And myself?” asked Rudenfranck, “shall I
not reap the harvest for which I have labored?
Recollect thy promises made me in Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are thine,” said the spirit. “This sceptre
controls the fiercest demons. Take it. Return to
thy native land, and revel in the possession of all
earthly wisdom, riches, and power. But when thy
date of life has again expired, seek not to renew it.
It is enough. Dismiss me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Depart to thy place, accursed spirit,” said the
hunter. The spirit of Bructorix descended, and the
phantoms hastened to pile the vases of gold and
jewels outside of the brazen gate, until the first grey
light of the dawn began to glimmer through the
clouds. Instantly, the gorgeous scene disappeared,
and the cavern resumed its original appearance.
Adolf and Rudenfranck, loading themselves with
gold, carefully filled up the mouth of the cavern
with rocks and brushwood, and returned warily,
homeward.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> guests of the preceding day were assembled
in the farm house of Philip Mullerhorn, eagerly
awaiting the arrival of Adolf. Old Mullerhorn
went frequently to the door, and looked out, with
anxiety, down the road which Adolf usually took
when he visited the farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear all is not right with him,” said he.
“Adolf is late in coming this morning. He should
have been here a full hour before this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peradventure,” snuffled Chriss, “the young man
has fled, doubting whether he could make good his
boasts of yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so fast, my good friend,” said the voice
of Adolf himself, who then entered, bearing in
his hand a valise, evidently containing articles of
weight. “We shall soon prove whose boasts shall be
first accomplished.” As he spoke, he threw the valise
upon the table, before Mullerhorn, “I am come,”
said he, “Father Philip, to receive my bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens!” said Barbara, earnestly regarding
the countenance of Adolf, “what has thus blanched
thy brow, and changed thy visage? Thy cheek is
ghastly, and thy look unearthly! Why glares thine
eye so wildly? What hast thou done? The light
of thine eye is not from heaven! Holy Virgin! the
cave! the cave!” cried she, fainting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adolf, what ails thee?” asked Mullerhorn.
“Thy brow is indeed pale, and thine eye fierce and
blood-shot. Thou comest from no holy work this
morning. Hadst thou the whole treasure of earth, no
daughter of mine, Adolf Westerbok, should’st thou
wed, until the secret of thy conduct is explained.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is nothing,” said Adolf, stammering as he
spoke, “a weariness—a sickness—it will soon be
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear the mark on thy brow is of no earthly
malady. Remain here no longer. Depart from us,
for thy society is not for that of Christian men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I come to claim my bride!” cried Adolf,
hoarsely, “and to pay the dower. No man shall
prevent me from this. Why gaze ye thus on me?
Stand back; the man who interferes in this shall
rue his intrusion. Barbara, dear Barbara, you
cannot, do not thus repulse me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adolf,” said Barbara, gaining courage, and her
voice before faltering, becoming firm and steady,
“depart from me. All is now explained. Thy
anxiety of last evening; thy expedition to the cave
of Schwearenheim; all is explained. Barbara Mullerhorn
may have loved thee, and she did so; but
she will never consent to be the bride of a forsaken
wretch like thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden exclamation from Piet Albrecht attracted
the attention of all present, and aroused
Adolf from the stupor into which the words of
Barbara had thrown him. The room was filled
with a rich, purple light, in which the figure of
Rudenfranck, arrayed in his magical vestures, and
holding the ivory sceptre of Bructorix, appeared to
the terrified spectators. Well might they be terrified;
for upon the brow of the hunter a brilliant
star gleamed brightly with a sulphurous light, and
his tall figure seemed to dilate to superhuman size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why dost thou stare at me?” sneered Rudenfranck
to Adolf, who gazed upon him with a
bewildered look; “why dost thou stare at me?
Produce thy treasure and claim thy bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! no bride of hell!” shouted Mullerhorn.
“I doubted this yesterday. Away from us, Adolf
Westerbok; and thou, mysterious being, whether
thou be phantom or devil, in the name of God I
defy thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And see,” cried Mienckel, tearing open the
valise, “what is here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old chips of iron and leather, as I live,” said
Albrecht. “It is the Evil One. Let us fly from
here, else we die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolf gazed wildly at the valise, and with a loud
cry of despair, seized his rifle, and vainly endeavored
to destroy himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha!” laughed Rudenfranck, “thou hast
yet seven years to enjoy thy gold. These are the
treasures for which thou hast forfeited thy soul.
Miserable fool! Did’st thou think it mattered to
me whether thy fate was prosperous or not! Into
the snare thou did’st enter of thine own accord,
and thou must pay the penalty. Farewell! My
ends are accomplished! For the prescribed space
of my life, wealth, wisdom, and power in the fullest
are mine! That space expired, I will mock at thee
in the halls of the fiend. This sacrifice of thy soul
hath ensured my success, and I thank thee for it.
Farewell, Adolf Westerbok. Fool! idiot! driveller!
Thou hast thy hire, and I triumph over the world
of spirits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, he waved his magic sceptre. The
cloud enveloped him in its folds, and he disappeared,
with a laugh of malicious scorn.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>Barbara Mullerhorn survived the misfortunes
which had attended her early love, and lived
to marry a wealthy farmer of the neighborhood,
who proved himself every way worthy of her
choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Piet and Agatha also entered upon the matrimonial
engagement, and their descendants may still be
found among the hills.</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'>For some years after, a wan, gaunt, and ragged
wretch might have been seen toiling and digging
incessantly along the range of the Wolf Hills. The
fire of lunacy burned in his eye, he spoke to no one,
and never uttered language, save in his insane self-communings.
The neighbors universally shunned
him, and no charitable voice soothed his misery.
He dwelt in the gloomy cave by the run, where the
unholy rites of Rudenfranck had been celebrated.
His sole occupation consisted in a continual search
after hidden treasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seven years had elapsed since the occurrences
above narrated, were reported to have taken place,
when a hunter, pursuing his game among the Wolf
Hills, accidentally discovered the dead body of a
man, shockingly torn and mangled, at the entrance
of the cavern of the recluse. It was the corpse
of Adolf Westerbok, the Silver Digger of the
Wolf Hills.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>NOTE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This legendary tale, we learn, is founded upon a
superstitious tradition, still current among the backwoodsmen
of Pennsylvania. The outline of the tale
is preserved as far as the nature of the legend would
permit. The cavern is yet to be seen, where the
hidden treasures are supposed to have been concealed;
and the hardy hunter of the mountains still regards it
with fear, and prefers taking a long circuit through
the woods, to passing the cavern after nightfall. The
whole country, indeed, is full of such traditions, which
only require the pen of a Scott to be perpetuated,
alike for the amusement and wonder of posterity. Let
no man say that America is without legendary lore,
let no one deny that she affords materials for poetry!
Every hill; every stream; every valley; every plain
has its own wild story of border troubles, or Indian
traditions. When shall <span class='it'>our</span> minstrel arise to hallow
them in undying song?—<span class='sc'>Eds.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:2em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Servilius to Cornelius—Greeting</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Your</span> reply to my last epistle, my dear Cornelius,
was the more pleasing, because so unexpected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speed of its transmission shows the great
measure of our obligation to the sagacity and enterprise
of Constantine. For who, until our emperor
bent to it the considerations of his active mind,
ever knew of such rapidity of communication?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fair lines before me, I again greet the face
of a friend, and hold cheering communion with one
divided by long distance. I promised in my last to
give you some description of the curious ceremonies
of those worshippers, and I find you are urgent that
I should fulfil it, since I was so fortunate as to witness
some of the hidden mysteries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You esteem it strange that I, a foreigner, and
but a few hours in Baalbec, should have stood at
once upon such good terms with Mobilius, as to
have induced him to conduct me to one of the
most secret recesses of the temple—with all the
perils of exposure through my carelessness. I have
nothing to offer in answer to your surmise but conjecture.
Mobilius was certainly upon some familiar
footing with the priests, and perhaps being partly
moved by the hope that the imposing magnificence
of the ceremonial would win a convert to his creed,
he ventured to introduce me. If such was his anticipation,
how signally in error! how vain to fancy
that the sense can blind the judgment! that the
splendor of the cloud that curtains some yawning
chasm in the mountain side, can be mistaken for
the solid pathway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had long gone down beneath the dizzy
peaks of Lebanon, indeed night had far advanced,
when Lactantius, Mobilius, and myself, properly
arrayed in dark vestments, sallied toward the temple
of the sun. Hurried along at a rapid pace, for
he feared we had tarried too long, we soon came
in view of the temple’s towering portico, which
may still be seen by the curious stranger, even in
the absence of the moon; for ever-burning lamps,
filled, as they say, by never-failing oil, hang beneath
the architrave. Entering at the great door, we were
stopped by the porter, but recognising Mobilius,
he permitted us to pass, without farther scrutiny,
though he was evidently displeased; for although I
could not clearly distinguish what he spoke, I heard
him mutter angrily in the Syrian tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did not cross the grand courts, which, like
the portico, were filled with perpetual lamps, but
hastened through low corridors, vaults, and crooked
passages, which might defy the skill of man to
retrace, but Mobilius seemed well accustomed to
them, so that I inferred he had acted as a guide on
more than one occasion. After endless windings,
we came into an archway, faintly lighted from
without, and proceeding farther, entered a dark
room. Here we were obliged to grope our way,
and were commanded by Mobilius to tread with the
utmost caution. We speedily, however, came to a
spot, from which we beheld the great floor of the
temple, through a narrow opening, artfully concealed
in one of the ornaments of the entablature. All
was still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Earlier than I expected,” whispered Mobilius,
“the ceremonies have not yet begun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This leisure enabled me to examine the exquisite
architecture of the edifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The temple was the loftiest of all those that surrounded
it, and which had their position and style
of architecture in strict reference to this, as their
great centre. The roof was of marble, and I could
clearly distinguish, by the lamps around, the delicacy
and lightness of its mouldings, pannels, and compartments.
In the centre was a sun, carved in the full
glory of his rays: marshalled at equal distances, surrounded
by its sculptured edge, and sunk deeply
into the marble, like a picture in its frame, were
the heads of Venus, or as this people designate her,
the “Syrian Goddess,” and also of Jupiter and
other deities; and if I do not err, I could discern,
constellated like the rest, the heads of Antoninus,
and of other Roman emperors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marble walls were carved with niches and
tabernacles disposed in two rows, which were filled
with statues, between the floor and the roof, and
supporting the latter, stood pilasters and columns
of the same order as those which sustain the architrave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the tesselated pavement in the centre of
the temple was erected a gorgeous altar, composed
in part of precious metals, and of rare and various
marbles, tastefully inlaid, and yet all designed in
conformity with the strict rules of the architect.
The fires upon it threw a reddened glow upon the
walls and pillars, and a representation of the sun
seemingly illumined from within, by a mildly burning
light, whether real or unsubstantial, I cannot
say, hovered above the altar, resembling the undulating
brightness which the agitated waters in the
vase cast upon the tapestry, or the flickering pale
reflection of the moonbeams on the ground, as they
struggle through the trembling leaves. My thoughts
now reverted to the ceremonies we had come to
witness, and some perplexing fancies, in spite of
resolution, stole upon me. First, the brief acquaintance
of Mobilius; the knowledge that Lactantius
was a Christian, and his increased apparent dislike
of that form of worship, since Constantine had
threatened to close the temples of his faith; and
Lactantius had expressed a hope it might be so,
and the fact that there was, unquestionably, a connection
between Mobilius and some of the priests.
But again I thought could he be so base as to
delude and betray those who had reposed such confidence,
and would not his fears prevent, if he even
would, because of the certainty of detection? While
these reflections were flashing through my mind,
the soft mingling of many voices swelling into the
full pitch of harmony, and then sinking and dying
as if wafted away upon the wings of the wind,
broke the spell, and aroused my attention. Such
clear, rich, enrapturing melody, I never heard, even
surpassing that which floated from the shores of
Cyprus; and a thrill of pain ran through my veins
as it suddenly ceased, just as if you were to dash a
harp into pieces in the midst of its sweetest outpourings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What means this?” I whispered, but a low
murmur from Mobilius brought me to instant silence.
Directly I heard a silvery ringing voice
swell forth a chaunting note, and all the voices
fell in one by one, with sweet and heavenly accord,
until the lofty temple echoed and re-echoed with
the sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great door then sprang asunder—without
the jarring of a hinge—by some imperceptible
agency, revealing in magnificent array, numerous
ranks of priests, clothed in vestments of the costliest
dyes, and walking to the sound of instruments,
with measured tread, in glittering procession. Some
bore many of the symbols of their faith—such as
the heifer’s head—the crescent, the golden bull—some
ears of corn, others silver torches, when
ascending the altar steps, they lit them at its fires,
which threw into still brighter effulgence, the dazzling
ornaments of the priests, and all the solemn
pageants. This was, as Mobilius whispered, the
splendid ceremonial which precedes the great sacrifice.
Now came a bewildering and elaborate observance
of the usual ceremonies, but so numerous
and complicated, that it were tedious to recount
them, if I even could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little the music was again heard, both
of instruments and voices, swelling, blending, and
pouring forth the same entrancing harmonies. The
priests, in three rows, circling round the altar, sent
up a swelling chaunt, and in a moment, as it were,
with the quickness of lightning, three bright fires
sprang from the different portions of the altar-top,
so brilliant, as that for many seconds, I was not
able to discern a vestige of what I had just seen.
At this, Mobilius, taking us by the hand, said, “we
must depart,” and led us by a different route from
that through which we entered. At one place, in
suddenly opening the gate, at the end of a long
passage, I was startled by a flood of light, illuminating
a colonnade, which seemed to lead into a subterraneous
passage, plainly connected with another
temple. We shortly reached the great door itself,
and glided through the portico, seemingly unobserved,
though I doubt not it was guarded by some
unseen janitor. We now emerged into the open
air, and hurried rapidly on. Upon turning to take
a parting glance at the temple, my eye was riveted
in deep and reverential admiration. The moon
was at a towering height, and shone down clear and
silvery. Not a cloud spotted the heavens, nor the
bright-eyed stars, that like watch-lights, palely burnt
around her. No sound disturbed the silence of the
night, except the faintly dying note of a trumpet, as
it softly echoed from some far, far distant battlement,
or the rattling of some chariot wheels in its
progress homeward, from the banquet of the wealthy
Heliopolitan, which lingered for a moment on the
ear, then was lost forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lights upon the temple paled away in the
eternal brightness of the queen of night, throwing
the portico in bold relief, as if it were covered with
a mantle of snow, and casting its deep recesses into
the shades of midnight. Beside the temple rose a
grove, bathed in a silvery flood of light, and the
tall obelisks, which being but faintly visible among
the foliage, stood like spectres, and upon steady
contemplation, appeared to stir from the place of
their foundation, such is the power of fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned; my companions were gone. They had
passed on unheeded, and I wandered as I best could
toward the mansion of Septimus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gorgeous streets of this great city, lined, as
they were, with marble palaces and temples, and
thronged but a few hours since with the gay, the
beautiful maiden of Heliopolis, or the busy wayfarer,
were now as silent as the place of tombs.
The cold beams of the pale moon shone still undimmed
and uninterrupted, save here and there by
a projecting shade or darkling grove, whose loftiest
boughs closely interweaving, reared a verdant arch,
revealing now and then through the thick foliage,
the night’s illumined heaven, and its cold azure
depths. So I wandered, cheered at intervals by
the soft murmur of the fountains among the trees,
whose waters sparkled in the moonbeams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This grove was ornamented with statues, and
verily, I believe, of all the Gods in the Pantheon,
among which was Mars, whose highly polished
shield shone like another moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now completely lost, I found myself near one of
the city gates, and hearing an approaching footstep,
I recognised a citizen, some gay Heliopolitan, I
supposed, returning from a midnight banquet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you tell me,” I enquired, “in what direction
lies the house of Septimus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! readily,” he answered, “I will go with
you, for it stands nearly in my path. I perceive,
my friend, you are a stranger, and we dare not
break our ancient rule of friendship.” Thanking
him for his kindness, we proceeded forward, and I
found him a communicative and entertaining companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray,” said I, “what noble edifice is that
immediately before us, now silvered by the moon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the temple of fortune, erected many
years ago, after some signal benefit had fallen on
the city, through the beneficence of the Gods. It
is the work of the lamented Epamenides, his first,
his last design,” and he appeared much affected by
the reflection. He continued, “behold the proportions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I no longer doubted but that my friend was
some young architect, enthusiastic in his profession,
and not being able to understand his learned
phrases, endeavored to divert the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what you say I cordially concur, but what
is fame and fortune since but a few lustres must
snatch us from their enjoyment, though they be the
highest and the brightest which the generosity and
admiration of our countrymen can award? Man
toils much ere he reaps, so that if the harvest is not
scanty it is ours for the enjoyment of but a brief
space.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not draw your conclusion,” said he,
“after the manner of the model of all that is great
in reason and philosophy. Were the votary to hold
such doctrines as these, he would never reach the
fires, however ardently he might fix his gaze upon
them; he would never attain the consummation of
his burning wishes. But he would reason after this
manner—toil would be well were the goal worth
the reaching. So mark the inconsistency.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although not convinced, I was compelled, forsaking
my former conjecture, to conclude that the
stranger was some eminent philosopher of Heliopolis,
so ingeniously did he argue. Though I
thought it could not be of so severe a school as
some sternly avow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walking a little, we met a man in the agonies
of a strange sickness. Here I fancied will be
afforded an opportunity of testing the truth of my
conjecture—for philosophers, especially those of
the present day, are ever ready to prescribe both
for afflictions of body and of mind precepts which
they are most rarely in the habit of practising themselves.
But I was again mistaken, for, taking the
sick man by the hand, he examined his pulse, and
closely scrutinised his features, upon this abstracting
a small casket, containing medicines, from his
robes, he administered a portion, and its good effects
were wonderful. All conjecture was now put to
flight; for I at once decided that my new friend
was a disciple of Hippocrates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How fruitless is all surmise, for he afterward informed
me he was a member of the forum, and held
an office under the emperor. This brought me to
the widely spreading portal of Septimus—which
almost seemed to welcome me after my absence.
I met Lactantius pacing to and fro the hall with
Mobilius, as if theirs had been an intimacy of
months. “Ah!” said the latter, “we were about
sallying out for you—but yet knew it would prove
of no avail in such a city as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome,” exclaimed Lactantius, “I was
anxious on your account. How came you to
leave us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not leave you—it was you who left me—doubtless
in the heat of controversy upon the Chaldean
mysteries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand your meaning, Servilius,” said he,
smiling, “but how came you here at all; you are
not acquainted with the streets of Baalbec, especially
by moonlight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through the kindness,” I replied, “of Apicius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are fortunate,” ejaculated Mobilius, “and
should deposite your offering to-morrow in the temple
of fortune, as is the custom here. He is the
first of statesmen and advocates; an accomplished
orator, and a very generous and learned citizen.
If he pressed you to visit him at his palace, you
are still more fortunate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so he did,” I rejoined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It proved as Mobilius predicted, for I did not
meet a kinder or more noble-hearted friend than
this same Heliopolitan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it is late,” observed Lactantius, “we will
seek our couches, and to-morrow,” archly glancing
at Mobilius, “we may examine the Egyptian mysteries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I must draw to a conclusion, least I should
sketch this epistle to a tedious length. I bid you
an affectionate</p>

<div><h1><a id='sacc'></a>THE SACCHARINEOUS PHILOSOPHY.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>“Her ‘prentice han’ she try’d on man, and then she made the <span class='it'>Lasses</span> O.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gentle</span> reader—art thou fond of molasses? Not
only molasses in its simple state, but in its various
compounds? If thou art not I pity thee. Thy
taste relishes not that which would otherwise be a
source of inexpressible pleasure. Eatables may be
divided into the two great classes of the sweet and
the sour. From the full enjoyment of at least one-half
then of the good things of life (and that the
better half) art thou deprived. Again I pity thee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But some may say, that although not lovers of
molasses or sugar, (as I shall consider them the
same in this essay,) yet they are really very fond of
many sweet things. They like a portion of the
saccharine, though not fond of the gross and clogged
sweetness of molasses. Let such, however, think
not of escaping in this manner. What! like a
thing in part and not in fulness—like the rose-bud
and not the open rose—like an amiable and not a
perfectly angelic being—like five dollars and not five
hundred—like middling and not good health—like
imperfect and not perfect happiness—like strawberries
and cream, and not sugar or molasses—I
tell thee, man, woman, or child—Caucasian, African,
or Malay, thou art crazy, bewitched, or tasteless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How shall I describe the delicious sensations
which the saccharine matter imparts to the outward
man? Alike in fruit, and flower, and honey-comb
most gratefully apparent. And thou, ice-cream!
who has so often diffused throughout the body of
this “me,” a most delicious coolness, what wouldst
thou be without that essence, whose merits I am
exalting? Insipid and unmeaning, like unto a
flower without color or fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! how well can I remember the time, when,
released from school, I hastened home, and, sitting
on the kitchen door-sill, enjoyed my bread and molasses.
I never felt more thankful than when, plate
in hand, and a huge slice of the wheat loaf in reserve,
the preparatory pause was made “according
to the good order used among friends.” And then,
also the “switchel,” that nutritious and cooling
drink, (molasses and water, with a <span class='it'>little</span> vinegar,)
with which our revolutionary fathers quenched their
thirst, when rooting up their ditch on old Bunker.
Even the horrid tales told me in childhood by the
pestered servants, of thumbs, and fingers, and bloody
streaks, the evidence of cruel treatment in the Indian
isles, turned not the edge of my keen desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I shall no longer occupy paper with the
advocacy of the merely sensual claims of molasses.
It has other and higher demands upon your notice.
The author of this lately perused, with pleasure,
that most important work upon “The Philosophy
of Clothes,” by Thomas Carlyle. It suggested an
interesting train of thoughts upon the subject before
us. Molasses, and its kindred sweets are the well
fitting garments of the spirit of love and purity.
Here then we have an unfailing index by which to
judge of the characters of our fellow men. Herein
is contained the germ of our new and spiritual
philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles Lamb in his “Elia,” quotes and endorses
the sentiment of one of his friends: “that no man
be entirely reprobate who is fond of apple-dumplings.”
This I grant to be true. He did not,
however, remember that both the apples and the
dumplings contain a portion of saccharine matter;
and this accounts <span class='it'>partly</span> for the dislike felt toward
them by a reprobate spirit. And again—who ever
heard of eating apple-dumplings without sugar or
molasses? I therefore bring Charles Lamb, who,
although he did not perceive the great <span class='it'>principle</span>
coiled up in this succulent eatable, has taken notice
of the above interesting <span class='it'>fact</span>, as a witness to the
truth of my theory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When do we find that the love of all sweet things
most commonly prevails? In youth undoubtedly.
When the mind is pure, free from worldly guile,
innocent, and <span class='it'>lamb</span>-like. When the fresh and untainted
spirit drinks eagerly and deeply at the fount
of truth, and its type or representative on earth
(according to Swedenborg) pure water. Then,
sugar-plumes are a delight—ginger-bread a blessing—molasses
candy, especially when rolled and
pulled out into sticks, <span class='it'>bright</span> or <span class='it'>dull</span> yellow, according
to the cleanliness of the maker’s hands, “the
staff of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child becomes a man. He grows selfish and
proud. He loses his relish for innocent enjoyments,
and with it his taste for molasses. The spirit of
love becomes impregnated with impure desires, and
his outward man changes accordingly. The saccharine
matter no longer suits him in its natural
state—it must be fermented, and gases added, and
gases deducted, to correspond with the altered soul.
What a beautiful emblem is this change of saccharine
substance to the poisonous liquor, of the transition
state of the immortal in man. First the
spirit as in childhood, pure and gentle, like the
sweet juice of the grape. Then youth, with its
noble and generous bearing, comparable to the
result of the first fermentation. Manhood comes
on, and with it the fermentation proceeds. Soon
the soul is agitated with innumerable gases—and
from their bubblings, and combinations, and effervescence,
it comes forth a new creature. Well
satisfied are most if they go no farther than this,
but succeed in calming the troubled elements at this
second fermentation. While some, unable to arrest
their progress, plunge into the third and woful state;
from which, if they succeed in coming out, they
appear all soured, and be-vinegared, your universal
fault-finders and found-fault-with. Too many, alas!
emerge not even at this third gate, but dash recklessly
into the fourth, the last and worst, and hope-decaying
state—and when dragged through it, are
cast out with the blessed feelings of childhood putrified—the
flesh rotted off, and exposing the then
loathsome skeleton of the soul, the never to be
destroyed framework of an eternal nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How beautiful also the resemblance in another
sense. Wherever you meet the poison fire, under
whatever name it may assume, whether brandy, gin,
whiskey, wine, cider, or beer, as you are confident
that the innocent sugar must have been its basis;
so in whatever form you meet vice in the human
heart, you may be also assured, that there was, and
perhaps is yet, in that heart a stronger or weaker
basis of God-like love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the good, spiritually, is to be considered
the cause of the liking for the saccharineous, yet
they are to some extent mutually creative. The
outward may appeal so strongly as even to produce
the inward. “Hang up a coat in the highway, and
will it not soon find a body to fill it?” Who has
not often observed the child when requested by its
parents to swallow the bitter dose of (so called)
medicine? What a struggle between duty and disgust!
What measures are then taken by the wise
parent in order that the right may conquer? How
is the virtuous appealed to and strengthened? One
single lump of sugar, perhaps not larger than a
hickory nut decides the question. Duty prevails.
How shall we account for such things without
adopting a similar doctrine to that which I have
thus partly illustrated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader, thou wilt believe or not, as thou choosest.
But before this is dismissed as unworthy, for thy
own sake, examine facts. Find among thy acquaintances,
that man, sullen, and morose, and cruel, who
loves molasses. Understand me—<span class='it'>loves</span> molasses—not
who sometimes eats it, but who clings to it with
a passionate devotion—who prefers it to the best
pie ever baked, apple, mince, peach, or cranberry,—as
I do. If thou canst find such a being—thou
thinkest I’ll recant? Not I. Such a man is an
anomaly, a monster, deserves not to live—and if he
knows what a beautiful theory he is practically
marring, and has the least spark of generosity
within him, is willing to die. If he wont die I care
not,—he’s only an exception, and “proves the truth
of the general rule,” as all metaphysicians will tell
thee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it were needful I could skip from individuals
to nations—could prove the truth of my doctrines
by referring to the Irish with their potatoes, buttermilk,
and whiskey—the Hindoo and his rice—the
West Indian slave with his patient endurance, the
result of his frequent sucking at the juicy cane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But why multiply proof? Why refer to the bee
with his industrious habits, caused by living entirely
upon honey—the bear with his good nature, hugging
you, even when in anger, to his bosom, how
he also likes sweet things—the humming-bird, with
its love for the sweets of flowers—the—but why
instance more?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! ye wise, give ear while I call your attention
to this new philosophy, which I name saccharine,
and not transcendental. Parents, guardians, physicians,
nurses,—“they that have ears to hear let
them hear.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> life ceases to afford us gratification, we
not unfrequently take a strange delight in reviewing
and pondering over the misdeeds of the past, and
in anticipating the weird and desolate future. This
revelling in the consequences of our own depravity;
this spirit of darkness and recklessness; this tendency
to a defiance of all moral and religious consolation—when
morality and religion no longer
dwell within us—may be termed the wreck of
hope, and life, and salvation; for as the mariner,
engulphed by the tempest, faces death in boisterous
revelry, so we seek to riot in our own wickedness,
and plunge into perdition, rejoicing in the sin, and
reckless of its consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even while I write, the recollection of deeds
which might well cause the blood to curdle and
the flesh to crawl, thrills me with an awful and
savage delight. The open gates of hell are ready
to receive me, but I rejoice in anticipating the hour
of eternal ruin!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am a native of Italy—a Venitian by birth; a
wanderer by choice. During the political disturbances
under the doge, Paolo Reniers, I obtained
an office of considerable value; by which I was
enabled to enjoy a handsome annuity. For some
time the French forces, commanded by Bonaparte,
had been endeavoring to take possession of Verona;
and had already made some attempts on Venice;
but these eruptions were if any thing the
means of my promotion. Before the downfall of
my patron, I acquired a fortune which placed me
on a footing with the patricians of the day. Had
heaven so ordained it, I might then have retired to
my villa, and in peace and seclusion enjoyed the
fruits of my industry; but the seeds of avarice were
sown—I was destined to reap their harvest. The
intrigues of political life were not sufficiently disgusting
to deter me from applying for employment
under the government, to the successor of Reniers.
That wary craft which had rendered me so indispensable
to this corrupt and imbecile monarch, was
not overlooked by Lugi Manini; for in a country
where duplicity is the chief point, in the education
of individuals, to whom the official authority is
entrusted; and where art and cunning are so universal
as to render every man a match for his
fellow, superiority of this kind is regarded with
peculiar veneration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The satellites who swarmed about the court of
Manini, were not slow in betraying their jealousy
at the preference with which he regarded me; but
where jealousy exists there is dissention; and even
among my enemies I had my partisans. The
rancor of political strife rendered me fierce and
haughty; and few dared to avow their hostility in
my presence. Hardened in dissimulation, I could
at once assume the gentlest tones of friendship, or
the most cutting sarcasm, and the coldest frown of
dignity. Increase of influence gradually compelled
those who at first resorted to the basest methods
for my overthrow, to relinquish their attempts, and
acquiesce in my measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Power, however, was not my chimera. I had
contracted an undying thirst for riches. I longed
to regard myself as the master of millions. The
very clink of gold was sweeter to me than the
applause of an enraptured populace. Daily—hourly—my
thoughts were concentrated on the
darling object of my ambition. That cold and
stern temperament, which, in my political schemes,
had been fostered by every act of diplomacy, and
every duty of my office, rendered me callous to all
worldly allurements, save the desire of personal
emolument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Constantly moving in the gaudy circles of the
court, I was at once disgusted with the prodigal
splendor of every thing around me, and incited to
aspire for the most exalted degree of opulence.
Those whose power was greater than mine, I
merely looked upon as instruments by which the
great object of my life was to be effected. Even
Manini himself I did not consider in any other
light than as one ultimately to be the means of my
success. Deceit in the service of others had
made me too wary a courtier not to cloak my
designs in professions of the most disinterested
friendship toward him who was already the tool of
my machinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The schemes were too well concerted to fail.
A few years of untiring zeal found the doge still
nominally my patron, but in reality my minion.
Wealth had poured in upon me. No longer was
the desire of riches a chimera; no longer had I to
live in feverish and dreamy suspense; no longer
was I fortune’s votary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though in the prime of life, I too, passionately
loved the possession of my gold, to violate in my
enjoyment the strictest rules of economy. I gambled—but
that was my business. I drank—but the
excitement was necessary to sustain my vital principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having adhered to my victim till he was weak and
worthless, I abandoned him for more lucrative game.
I sought out the haunts of the young and inexperienced.
I became a kind of polite sharper; for
though I generally gambled for the riches of my
victims, I so managed as to secure the spoils in defiance
of ill-fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all know that the peculiar vices of a man’s
character increase in extent as his evil course of
life is persisted in; even when that course is not
more intrinsically depraved by continuance. It was
the case with me. I did not actually rob; I did
not murder; I committed no more heinous crime
than that of swindling or gambling; and yet every
day I became a worse and worse black-hearted
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before this epoch in my career had drawn to a close,
I became acquainted with the daughter of a Venitian
banker. She was not beautiful; she was not accomplished;
she was not amiable—but she was rich. At
this time, I too, was rich. Both fortunes united would
make a brilliant coalescence. I pressed my suit,
and succeeded. The foolish girl did not discover
till too late, that I despised herself, though I adored
her fortune. My wealth was now immense; and
it might be supposed that I was satisfied; but my
thirst for accumulation was only excited by what I
had already acquired. Had I been possessed of the
world’s wealth, I am pursuaded I would have wept,
like Alexander, because there was nothing left to
satisfy my desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That fortunate tissue of events which had hitherto
marked my career, was destined to be speedily
reversed. In Venice there lived at this time an individual,
who, if he had not my boldness of purpose
and capacity for scheming, was at least my
equal in shrewdness and avarice. This person was
called Carlo Dolci—a nomenclature which he
boasted as certain evidence that he was descended
from the great painter of that name. Dolci met
me at my accustomed resort—one of those hells with
which Venice then abounded. His appearance was
peculiarly forbidding; but I fancied I had seen too
much of the world to be prejudiced by mere outward
show. We were introduced by a mutual
friend. I found that my new acquaintance was a
man of some knowledge, and of polished and persuasive
manners. His characteristic trait was extreme
cunning; nor did his grey, twinkling eye and
piercing glance contradict what his manners and
language bespoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One topic led to another. We spoke of games.
Dolci with his infernal art, flattered me out of all
prudence, by declaring he had heard so much of
my skill at play that he was determined to avoid
strife in such an accomplished quarter. Fired with
a desire to verify his words, I immediately challenged
him. We began with moderate stakes, and
I won. We doubled, and I still won. We continued
to increase the stakes till they amounted to
an immense sum. Both were equally excited; but
my good fortune did not yet leave me. Dolci, I
knew, was rich; and I was determined to fleece
him. I doubled the largest stakes we had yet contended
for. Dolci was the winner. Maddened at
such an unusual reverse, I dared him to contend—fortune
against fortune! Each now staked his entire
wealth. It was to be riches or poverty to me.
The swollen veins stood out on my forehead. A
cold perspiration teemed from the brow of Carlo
Dolci. His teeth were clenched; his hair wild and
matted—his eye unusually haggard. The dice were
thrown. I gasped for breath. A dimness came
over my eyes. With a dreadful effort I strained
them to catch a glimpse of my fate. Merciful
God! I had lost—I was a beggar!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a grim smile, Dolci grasped the stakes. I
rushed from the hell, a frenzied wretch. A mocking
laugh was borne after me; and I knew no more.
For several days I was a raving maniac. When I
recovered my reason, I found myself stretched on
a pallet in my own house. My wife stood by, with
disgust and hatred pictured in her countenance.
Her first words were those of contumely and reproach.
She did not make any allowance for my
situation; she reflected not that it was the province
of the female to forgive error, and to administer
consolation. I married her for her money; that
was gone, and I now was to feel all the miseries
of my choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only solace to my afflictions, was a little
daughter about eight years old, but uncommonly
mature both mentally and physically. She attended
me with untiring assiduity; she lifted the cup to my
lips; she soothed with her silvery tones the agony
of my mind; she sang for me her plaintive airs;
she bathed my burning temples; she prayed for me—she
wept for me—she was every way the beau ideal
of innocence and affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” she would say, “why do you clench
your hands—why do you rave of ruin and beggary?
We shall all go to work when you recover; and
we shall earn more money and be very happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas poor Valeria! she little knew the loss I had
sustained. It was not the loss of luxury for that I
never enjoyed; it was not the loss of domestic peace—for
I was a stranger to it; it was not the loss of
reputation, for I cared nothing about it; but it was
the loss of <span style='font-size:smaller'>MONEY</span>—of that which gave the only zest
and pleasure to my life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One mortification was spared us in our beggary.
No splendid edifice was to be abandoned—no luxurious
equipage to be sold—no servants to be dismissed—no
fine costumes to be sacrificed—no sensitive
feelings to be wounded by a change from affluence to
penury and want; our condition remained unaltered.
While blessed with riches I was too careful of them
to be guilty of extravagance. My avarice, not my
prodigality, was my ruin. I did not gamble for the
pleasure of the game, but from sheer desire to accumulate
immense sums of money. I then conducted
my affairs on a grand scale. Wealth poured in on
me not by degrees, but in floods. Now, however,
the time arrived when I was doomed to begin a new
career under new auspices. I had no Reniero or
Manini to plunder by a few acts of political sagacity.
I had no immense states to retrieve my want of
luck with Carlo Dolci. To toil up the rugged path—to
exert my humble acquirement—to trade—to
barter—to beg—were now the only means in my
power to make amends for want of prudence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having settled my wife and daughter in a small
house, I procured, partly on credit and partly with
what little was left, a meagre stock of jewelry, with
which I sallied out as a travelling pedlar. By
adopting this course of life I sacrificed no fine feelings;
I never was proud of any thing except of my
riches. I considered not that because I had wielded
an intriguing pen in the great contest between Bonaparte
and Lugi Manini, my dignity would in any
degree be lessened by honest exertions for the retrieval
of my fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The succeeding epoch in my career may be
passed over. To detail the vicissitudes of my wandering
life—to dwell upon the manifold reverses of
fortune—to trace succinctly the gradual and disheartening
manner in which I acquired money—and
to portray the eagerness—the infantile delight
with which I grasped it and hoarded it to my bosom—would
be alike futile and uninteresting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In struggling between penury and avarice, the
autumn of my life passed away. The misery of
connubial contention, I am persuaded, whitened the
hair of my head, even before my winter had blasted
it with its frosts; but heaven ordained it that my
declining age should not be harassed by the persecutions
of her with whom I had never known an
hour of true happiness. She died in a fit of madness—a
malady to which her passionate and ungovernable
temper had frequently subjected her. It
would be adding hypocrisy to my manifold sins to
say that I regretted this instance of divine dispensation.
I still had a companion—differently, but no
less intimately dependent on me for her support and
protection. This was my daughter, who had attained
her eighteenth year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valeria was beautiful—extremely beautiful. I
had roamed in the Florentine and Venitian Vatican;
I had studied, if not with the eye of an artist,
at least with the eye of an ardent admirer, the most
exquisite productions of Georgione, Titian, Correggio,
and Veronese; I had dwelt in ecstacy on the
master-works of every school from the Appellean
and Protogenean, to the Lombard, the Bolognese,
the Carraci, and the Rasain; but I had never seen
any thing either ideal or substantial, so exquisitely
symmetrical—so etherially chiselled in every feature—so
thoroughly the impersonation of angelic
beauty and sweetness, as Valeria. I speak it with
a father’s pride; I may be partial, but I believe I
am sincere. The dark, luxuriant hair—the languishing
eye—the finely rounded arm—the faultless
figure bespoke Italian blood; and that too of a
gentle quality; for though I claim no distinction, I
am myself of noble descent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Valeria, then, I saw my future fortune. I
had sufficient to support life; but I desired wealth.
To sell my daughter to the best advantage was
now the sole and engrossing subject of my thoughts.
I cared not whether I gained her an honorable alliance
or not; money, not titular distinction, was
the object for which I determined she should be
sacrificed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There lived in Venice, at this time, a Neapolitan
nobleman, of agreeable and accomplished manners,
and fine fortune, named Don Ferdinand Razzina,
upon whom I had long looked as the instrument
by which my schemes were to be consummated.
Razzina was young and volatile. His imprudence
rendered him easily subservient to my machinations.
By the most consummate art I managed that he
should get a glimpse at Valeria. This proved sufficient
stimulus to an ardent imagination, to fire him
with the most extravagant notions of her beauty.
He had barely seen her as a flitting shadow: that
shadow surpassed to him in loveliness the beau
ideal of his airiest dreams. I knew too much of
the human heart not to concert my measures on
the fact that mystery is the food of love; and in a
very short time Don Ferdinand was supplicating at
my feet for information concerning the fairy vision
he had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” said he, “shall be spared in remuneration
for your services. I love her. I shall never
love another. My peace and happiness for ever
more depend on her. If you respect the passions
common to humanity; if you are not devoid of
every feeling of sympathy; if you value your own
welfare, and my peace of mind—procure me an
interview!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schooled in cunning, I treated the matter with
indifference; I dwelt on other themes—but finding
Don Ferdinand deaf to aught, save the engrossing
object of his thoughts, I consented to introduce
him, on an enormous advance, to my daughter.
He seemed much surprised at this declaration; for
he had fancied—from what cause I know not—that
Valeria was my protege, and the unfortunate
pledge of some noble amour. In a moment the
truth of my schemes burst upon him. He was
young—ardent—impetuous—but he neither wanted
penetration nor humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretch!” he cried, with all the indignant
fervor of one unaccustomed to such unnatural cupidity—“you
would sell your daughter’s honor!—you
would ruin her for your own emolument!”
He paused in agitation for some moments, during
which I maintained a grim and stony smile—then
continued, “but your villainy is nothing to me. I
shall not upbraid you for what turns to my own
advantage. Here is the sum. Recollect, however,
<span class='it'>we perfectly understand each other as to the terms</span>.”
I answered merely by a leering nod of the head.
Razzina departed—promising to call on the ensuing
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That short but active interview had laid bare the
character of the noble prodigal. He was evidently
gifted with no common intellect. He had seen
little of the world; so that whatever sagacity he
had was inherent. Much good was mixed with
the evil which formed his prominent traits. He
was young and passionate; but he had no small
share of the milk and honey of human kindness.
His opinions respecting my course I regarded
with contempt. I had studied too deeply
the mysteries of human nature to be baulked in
my designs by a beardless and soft-hearted youth.
I knew that the bait was too well administered to
be rejected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning to a miserable garret in which I
always slept to avoid the expense of furnishing
the lower part of the house, and also to enjoy the
solitude, I flung myself on a pallet, and spread the
gold on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A filthy lamp threw a sickly and flickering light
on every thing around. The wretched place was
strewn with rubbish and dirt; here and there lay a
broken stool, or the remains of a chair; in the
centre stood a greasy and ricketty table, and hung
up in confusion, on the walls, were battered tin-cups—a
few platters—a spoutless coffee-pot—and
sundry tattered habiliments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I glanced around me with a smile of sinister
meaning. I piled up the gold—threw it down
again—and scattered it about, and grasped it once
more with childish eagerness. Then, as if fearful
of detection, I hid it, fervently praying that the
Almighty would watch over, and preserve it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now necessary that my daughter should
become acquainted with part of my designs; and I
summoned her. In a moment she was at my feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valeria—” and as I addressed her, I endeavored
to modulate my voice into tones as affectionate
and as soothing as possible—“Valeria, we
are very poor—God knows we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but father why speak of it now? We
are as well off as most people, and I am sure we
need no luxuries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, you know not our poverty. You
see me now a decrepid and palsied old man. I am
unable to make a living; and henceforth on you I
must depend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall cheerfully do what I am able, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it my child—I know it; but your utmost
exertions cannot save us from starvation,
unless properly directed. Valeria, listen to me. I
ask you as a father will you obey my commands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As long as they are bounded by reason and
virtue, I shall. I have always obeyed you—I am
not disobedient, I sincerely believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valeria, can you love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can. I <span class='it'>do</span> love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! whom do you love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you, my father—and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love Marco da Vinci—I never intended to
deny it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a frenzy of rage and astonishment, I started
to my feet, and stood for some moments like one
transfixed. My lips were white; my mouth foamed;
my cheek was blanched; my eye fiery and distorted;
and my whole frame convulsed with passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s curse be on you!” I shrieked, shaking
my clenched hand in the face of the terrified girl—“God’s
curse be on you, for the declaration. <span class='it'>You</span>
<span class='it'>love Marco da Vinci?</span> May a father’s ban fall like
the flames of perdition on you! May the heart
that you so foolishly bestowed, be blighted and
withered in its bloom! May the avenging hosts
gather round you at your death-bed; and taunt you,
and riot in your agony!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father! Father! O, cease those horrible words!
you will drive me mad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I replied, in a stern but more softened
tone, “I shall not drive you mad, Valeria; but I
have news that will make you feel as if madness
would be a blessing. <span class='it'>You are sold.</span> Here is the
money”—and I drew forth the gold I had received
from Don Ferdinand. “Yes, to-morrow you will
be the mistress of Don Ferdinand Razzina.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!—so help me God!” cried Valeria, in a
voice so calm and determined, that I feared for the
success of my schemes; “death—aye, a thousand
deaths before dishonor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see,” I replied, with a grim smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>We shall!</span>” said Valeria, retiring; and in tones
so deep and ominous that I shuddered. She repeated,
“<span class='it'>we shall!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto I have devoted my pen almost exclusively
to the narrative of my own confessions. I
must now diverge a little to introduce the reader
to a character, of whom nothing has yet been
mentioned except his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marco da Vinci was a young painter, of extraordinary
talents, and great mental accomplishments.
He was descended from a noble house; and might
have enjoyed the height of affluence had not misfortune
set her seal upon him at an early age.
Favored in an unusual degree as to his mental and
physical capacities, he received all the care and
cultivation that a fond father could bestow; and on
attaining his eighteenth year few could boast a more
vigorous mind—a more profound education, or a
more chaste and amiable character. Thus far was
Marco successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smitten with an undying thirst for distinction, he
resolved henceforth to abandon the quiet enjoyments
of leisure and affluence, and dedicated himself altogether
to the nobler calls of ambition. Alas! he
knew not that he had yielded the substantial enjoyments
of life for a misnomer—a chimera!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the ardent hope of Da Vinci’s father, that
the youth should, at no remote period, occupy an
exalted station in the affairs of the government; but
the rancor and bitterness of political life had no
charms for the young enthusiast. Enraged and
disappointed at the unexpected determination of his
son, Don Ignatius da Vinci, abjured him in the
zenith of his passion—disowned him, and left him
an outcast and a beggar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ambitious Marco wended his way to Venice,
where his talents soon attracted the attention of a
distinguished painter. Under this individual, Da
Vinci studied with all the devotion of an enthusiast,
and an unfeigned lover of the art. A very short
time was requisite to make him a finished painter.
That pruning to rule—that softening and chastening,
which can only be attained by painful and
almost hopeless perseverance in most cases, were
soon mastered by the ardent disciple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of time, Marco da Vinci accumulated,
by his industry, sufficient capital to begin
business on a small scale. At first he succeeded
beyond his expectations; but soon he found that
novelty is the spice of patronage, and that before
him he had every probability of sinking into oblivion,
and of eking out his days in starvation. Too
proud to apply for assistance to those by whom he
had been so basely injured, he determined to submit
to his fate with manliness and fortitude, and to
merit, if possible, sufficient patronage to support
him, while he should by an extraordinary effort of
his pencil retrieve his past misfortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A premium had been offered by the Academy of
Arts, for the best portrait of a female that could be
placed in the gallery in time for the annual exhibition.
Da Vinci resolved to take his model from
nature. The fame of Valeria’s beauty was proverbial
throughout the city; and the candidate for the
palm of excellence, sought out our miserable tenement,
and implored permission to have a sitting.
Too proud of the opportunity to extend her reputation,
I consented to the proposition. Fool! fool!
that I was! Why could I not see the danger
of placing this young and ardent soul in such a
temptation? Da Vinci was young—handsome—and
intellectual: Valeria was innocent—amiable—and
beautiful—could they but love? Fool,
I say, fool that I was!</p>

<div><h1><a id='sports'></a>SPORTS AND PASTIMES.<br/>SHOOTING.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>We</span> open this month with the first of a series of
excellent papers on Shooting, from the pen of the
author of the paper on Angling, given in our last.
It contains some valuable hints to young sportsmen,
on the art of Taking Aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pursuit and destruction of wild animals for
security, food, clothing, or pastime, have been among
the occupations of men in all ages, since the primeval
<span class='it'>bruere</span> overspread the earth,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>And wild in woods the noble savage ran!</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Before the more refined arts are introduced into any
country, the chase is a necessity, and the chief business
of life. The stronger and more noxious animals
are destroyed for individual safety; the weaker for
food. It is not until civilisation and her handmaid
luxury have seated themselves, that the chase becomes
a pastime. Nor does it appear when the
sportsman first sprang into existence. There is no
corresponding word in any ancient language, since
that could not be called a sport which was a necessity.
It is probable that in the earliest ages of society,
the dog was the sole agent employed by the
hunter. Afterward various weapons, manual, missile,
and projectile—as the club, the dart, the arrow, were
used by the hunter and fowler. Then would follow
springs, traps, nets, and all that class of devices for
the capture of beasts and birds <span class='it'>feræ naturæ</span>, comprehended
in the term toils. As dogs were employed to
hunt quadrupeds, so, in process of time, hawks were
trained to bring down birds for the service of their
master. The arbalest or cross-brow, preceded the
matchlock, which, however, could scarcely be called
an implement of the chase, but which, in the order of
succession, brings us down to the rifle, and original
fowling-piece with its long, heavy barrel, and flint
and steel lock; and lastly, we arrive at the double
barrels and detant locks of the modern shooter.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i094.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>TAKING AIM.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> the dog points, or when birds rise near to
the shooter, he should immediately draw back one
hammer with the right thumb; experienced sportsmen
disapprove of the practice of cocking both
barrels at the same time. They think that it ought
to be a rule never to cock either barrel, until the
game be upon the wing, then that the left barrel
should be cocked and fired, and thereafter taken from
the shoulder. The right barrel should then be cocked
and fired if necessary; if not discharged, it should be
put back to the half-cock, and the left re-loaded. He
should never be in haste. It is more prudent to let the
bird escape than to fire hastily. If on open ground,
he should not fire until the bird is more than twenty
yards distant. He should be deliberate in bringing
up the piece to his shoulder, and in making it to bear
on the object, but the moment he has brought it to
bear, the finger should act in co-operation with the
eye, the eye being kept open the while, so that the
shooter may see whether the bird falls, or feathers
fall from it, for if he does not see it distinctly at the
moment of firing, there is something defective in his
system of taking aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shooter, when learning, should never aim
directly at the body of a rabbit on foot, or of a bird
on the wing. This precaution is scarcely necessary
when the motion of the object is slow, but by habituating
himself to it on all occasions, he will the
sooner become an adept. His mark should be the
head, the legs, or a wing, if within twenty yards.
When farther off, he should make some allowance,
according to the distance and speed of the object
moving. His aim should be at the head of a bird
rising or crossing—the legs of a bird flushed on an
eminence and moving downward from him—the
wing of a bird flying from him in an oblique direction.
His aim should be at the head of a rabbit, in
whatever way it may be moving. The same rules
apply when the object is more than twenty paces
distant from the shooter, making allowance for the
speed. Thus, for a partridge crossing, the allowance
of aim before it with a detonator, at twenty paces,
will be one inch—at thirty paces two inches—at fifty
paces five inches—at fifty-five paces seven inches.
Half this allowance will be proper when the bird
moves in an oblique direction. When an object
moves directly from the shooter, at more than twenty
paces distance, he should fire a little above it. When
a bird or rabbit approaches the shooter directly, he
should not aim at it until it has passed him, or has
turned aside. The moment it has altered its course
the gun should be brought up, and no time should be
lost in firing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not easy at all times to form a correct idea of
the distance of a bird from the gun. The nature of
the situation, and the state of the weather often deceive
the eye. Thus, on a bright day birds appear to
be near, and on a dull day distant. It is much easier
to estimate the distance of a bird in small enclosures,
where hedges or trees serve as guides, than on open
ground. The hedges, indeed, tend to deceive the
unpractised eye; the object is supposed to be much
farther off, while on open ground it is supposed to be
nearer, than it really is. It is often very difficult to
determine whether a grouse is within range; and
sometimes the mist increases the difficulty, for then
the bird is either scarcely seen, or else magnified, by
the sun’s rays gleaming through the mist, to an unnatural
size. In general, grouse are farther off than
they are supposed to be. The shooter, however, has
a peculiar sight: every bird he brings down, in good
style, is at sixty yards distance. It is amusing sometimes
to hear persons talk, after they have been
<span class='it'>watched</span>, of the distances at which they have effected
their shots; they ever think the game so much farther
off than it really was. The sportsman who has not
convinced himself by actual measurement, often
seems to be laboring under a species of hallucination
when speaking of his distances, and, if he bets on
them, to a certainty loses. Birds killed at fifteen
paces are thought to be at twenty-five, and those at
twenty-five are estimated at thirty-five or forty, and
so on to the end of the story!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a covey or brood rises, the shooter should
fix his eye on one bird, and shoot at that bird only.
He should not be diverted from it by other birds
rising nearer to him while he is bringing up his gun,
unless the bird he first set his eye upon be decidedly
out of all reasonable distance, so as to render the
chance of killing exceedingly remote. By observing
this rule, he is not only more certain of bringing down
his game, but he will more frequently kill the old
birds—a desideratum, for two reasons; first, because
he will, in all probability, disperse the covey, which
being done, any sportsman may generally, without
difficulty, bag a few brace; and secondly, because the
old birds make a better show in the game-bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We think that all shooters, except the veriest bunglers,
use a gun properly as regards throwing the end
of it upon the object aimed at, and drawing the trigger,
and that any inaccuracy of aim must be attributed
to the eye not being in the proper place when the aim
is taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The habit of missing arises not from inability to
throw the end of the gun upon the bird, but from the
eye not being directly behind the breech, which it
necessarily must be for good shooting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there were a sight at each end of the barrel, it
would be requisite, when taking aim, to keep shifting
the gun until both sights were in a line between the
eye and the mark; that, however, with a gun not well
mounted to the eye and shoulder, would be too complex
an operation, for before it could be performed,
a swift bird would be out of reach; it follows, then,
that the shooter’s attention should be directed only
to the sight at the top of the barrel; and the breech
end should come up mechanically to the proper level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a person is nervous, or afraid of the recoil,
he naturally raises his head, and consequently shoots
above the mark; on firing, he unconsciously throws
his head back, and then seeing the bird above the
end of the gun, he fancies he shot under it, when the
reverse is the fact. We may also observe that if the
shooter does not keep his head down to the stock, he
will probably draw it aside, so that his aim will be as
if taken from one of the hammers, which would, of
course, throw the charge as much on one side of the
mark, as raising the head would above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main point, then, in taking aim, is <span class='it'>to keep the
head down to the stock, and the eye low behind the breach</span>.
The sportsman who, from habit or practice, can invariably
bring his eye down to the same place, and keep it
steadily there, so that he may always take aim from
the same starting point, will distance all competitors.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“The Antediluvians, or the World Destroyed.” A
narrative poem, in ten books. By James McHenry,
M. D. Author of the “Pleasures of Friendship,”
&amp;c. 1 vol. J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.: Philada.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There are two species of poetry known to mankind;
that which the gods love, and that which men abhor.
The poetry of the Dr. belongs to the latter class,
though he seems lamentably ignorant of this, from the
long essay on taste which he has given to the world
in the shape of a preface to the work before us, and
in which his own peculiar merits and demerits are
discussed at sufficient length. He tells us that he has
long been tormented with an itching after immortality,
and that, being convinced not only that the writing of
a poem was the surest passport to it, but that the
choice of a subject was the greatest difficulty in the
way of such a work, he has spent some years of his
life in selecting the present theme. He has also the
modesty to acquaint the public that his subject is inferior
to Milton’s alone, leaving us, by a parity of reasoning,
to conclude that Dr. McHenry is next in glory
to the heavenly bard. We congratulate the Dr. on
his finesse. There is nothing like connecting one’s
name with that of a genius, for if the world is not deceived
by it, you persuade yourself, like Major Longbow,
by a constant repetition of your story, of its
truth. You become a great man in your own conceit,
fancy that the world does injustice to your talents, and
go down to posterity, if not as the falcon’s mate, at
least as</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“A tom-tit twittering on an eagle’s back.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus associated himself with Milton, the
Dr. proceeds to inform us that, in the Deluge, he at
length found a theme “exalted and extensive enough
for the exercise of poetic talents of the highest order,”
leaving us, a second time, to infer, what he is too
modest except to insinuate, that his own genius is unequalled.
He then calls our attention to the plot,
asserting that the general “plan and scope” of a
poem are second only to its theme—that is, that diction,
style, and imagination, in short every requisite
of a true poet, are but “flimsy stuff.” The Dr. seems
to know his own weak points, and when the “galled
jade winces;” but even his elaborated plot is worse
than nine men out of ten would construct. We have
gleaned little from it except a few facts, which would
be strange, were they not ridiculous. There is a description
of a harem in the second book, from which
we learn that velvets, and embroidery were as much
in vogue among the antediluvians as now; an account
of a siege in the eighth book, which settles the disputed
question, whether Greek fire, melted lead, and catapults,
were used then or not; and a detail of a battle
in the same book, which gives the divisions and
manœuvres of the contending armies, and puts at rest
the assertions of military men, who trace our present
tactics back no farther than the invention of gunpowder.
Besides this, there are two marriages—a rescued
maiden—one or more heroes, and as many heroines,
with an innumerable catalogue of minor incidents,
in short, the materials of a half a dozen bad novels,
woven into a worse poem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are told in the outset that the “versification is
not particularly modelled after that of any preceding
author,” and that our classic poets afford no style
“exactly suitable for this work,” and, consequently,
we are but little astonished when we meet with such
passages as the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we must bring a still heavier charge against the
Dr., that of a total want of originality. The whole
plan and conception of the Antediluvians is copied, but
“longo intervallo,” after Paradise Lost. Had Milton
never written poetry, Dr. McHenry would never have
published bombast. Yet the one is only the shadow
of the other’s shade. This imitation is perceptible,
not only in various attempts to copy the versification,
but oftentimes in more glaring and less defensible
plagiarisms. Would it, for instance, be believed that
the second book of the Antediluvians begins with a
passage so nearly resembling the opening of the
second book in Paradise Lost, as to make, as Dogberry
has it, “flat burglary?” Thus:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'>Satan exalted sat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so on diluting the idea of Milton into a dozen
more lines, and shewing, at once, the grandeur of the
model, and the feebleness of the imitation. Yet Dr.
McHenry calls himself a poet, and pretends to the
divine afflatus. But again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>We might multiply such instances;—but enough.
Has the Dr. forgotten the celebrated verse of Virgil?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Dr. appears fond of the use of epithets, especially
such ones as “infernal, fiendish, hellish,” and
other coarse adjectives. We do not object to the use
of the two former, provided they appear sparingly
and in place, but really the work before us is seasoned
rather highly with such epithets for our taste. The
Dr. however, appears to be of the Tompsonian
school in literature, and not only spices strongly, but
swashes away right and left at the accredited school.
We advise him, once for all, to give up poetry, which
he disgraces, for physic, which he may adorn. God
never intended him for an immortal fame. We are
satisfied that, if he should be arraigned for writing
poetry, no sane jury would ever convict him; and if,
as most likely, he should plead guilty at once, it
would be as quickly disallowed, on that rule of law,
which forbids the judges to decide against the plain
evidence of their senses.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“The Dream, and other Poems.” By the Hon. Mrs.
Norton. Carey and Hart, Philadelphia: 1841.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hemans, Baillie, Landon, and loveliest of all, Norton!—what
a glorious constellation for one language.
France with her gaiety: Italy with her splendid genius:
even Greece with her passionate enthusiasm, cannot
rival such a galaxy. And this glory too, belongs
wholly to the present century, for though the harp of
England has often been struck by female hands, it has
heretofore only given forth a rare and fitful cadence,
instead of the rich, deep, prolonged harmony which
now rolls from its chords.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Norton is unquestionably,—since the death of
Mrs. Hemans, the queen of English song. In many
respects she resembles that gifted poetess: in some
she is strikingly dissimilar. The same pathos, the
same sweetness, the same fancy characterize both;
but in all that distinguishes the practised author,
rather than the poetess, Mrs. Hemans has the advantage
of her successor. Thus, the one is sometimes
faulty in the rhythm: the other never. Mrs. Norton
will now and then be betrayed into a carelessness of
diction; Mrs. Hemans was rarely, if ever, guilty of
such solecisms. Such expressions, for instance, as
the “harboring” land, the “guiding” hand, the “pausing”
heart, the “haunting” shade, and others of like
character, taken at random from the volume before
us, though not strictly improper, yet, as they are
plainly expletive, and weaken, instead of strengthening
a sentence, are never to be found in the poems of
Mrs. Hemans, or of any one “learned in the craft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, if Mrs. Norton is less correct than Mrs. Hemans,
she is, on the other hand, more nervous, more
passionate, and at times more lofty. No one can
read “The Dream” without being struck by the truth
of the remark, that Mrs. Norton is the Byron of our
female poets. There are passages in some of her
poems of greater power than any passages of like
length in Mrs. Hemans’ writings, though at the same
time, there are a far greater number of inferior lines
in the poetry of Mrs. Norton, than in that of her
gifted sister. In short, the one is the more equal, the
other is the more daring. One is the more skilful
writer: the other shows glimpses of a bolder genius.
There is less prettiness, and not so much sameness in
Mrs. Norton as in Mrs. Hemans. The former is not
yet, perhaps, the equal of the latter, but she possesses
the power to be so, if her rich fancy and deep feeling,
now scarcely known to herself, should ever be brought
so completely under her control as were the talents
of Mrs. Hemans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Mrs. Norton had written nothing before, this
volume would have established her claim to be the
first of living poetesses; but who that is familiar with
the world of song can forget the many gems—rich,
and beautiful, and rare—with which she has spangled
beforetime her starry crown? The world has taken
more care of her glory than she has herself, and the
random pieces she has poured forth so divinely at
intervals, and which hitherto she has made no effort
to preserve, have found their way into the hearts of
all who can be touched by the mournful or the beautiful,
until her name is cherished alike in the humble
cottage and the princely hall. And now she has
come forth in more stately guise, not as a new author
among strangers, but as one long tried and known,
one endeared to us by old association, one whose
melancholy music is, as it were, a part of our very
being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Dream” is the longest poem in the volume
before us, but, as it makes no pretension to be considered
a story, and has really no plot, we shall not
judge it by the ordinary rule of criticism. We shall
consider it only as a string of pearls, loosely joined
together by the simplest contrivance, the idea of a
dream, narrated by a daughter to her mother,—and,
judging it in this way, we give it unqualified praise.
That its merit is unequal, is, in our eyes, no objection
to its beauty,—for have not all poets skimmed the
ground as well as soared to heaven? Yes! “The
Dream” is unequal, but so is Lallah Rookh, so is
Marmion, so are all the tales of Byron, and so—to
ascend a step higher—is Comus, or Hamlet, or even
the Iliad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Norton, like her gifted sister, possesses
one quality which distinguishes her above all other
writers, in this or in any tongue—we mean in giving
utterance to, what is emphatically, <span class='it'>the poetry of woman</span>.
In this they resemble no cotemporary, unless
it is Miss Landon. Women have written poetry
before, but if it had been shewn to a stranger, he
could not have told from which sex it sprung. It is
not so with the poetry of these two gifted females.
Every line betrays the woman—each verse breathes the
tender, the melting, the peculiar eloquence of the sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely a page, moreover, occurs in the writings
of either, which does not bear testimony to woman’s
suffering and worth. Yes! while it is the fashion to
sneer at the purity of woman’s heart, and while a
pack of literary debauchees are libelling our mothers
and our sisters unopposed, from the ranks of that insulted
sex have risen up defenders of its innocence,
to shame the heartless slanderers to silence. Hear
in what eloquent numbers Mrs. Norton vindicates
her sex:</p>

who would rob the sex of their purity of heart, and

written thus,—few indeed have done so except
Byron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must pass “The Dream” with a single other
quotation. It is on the evening hour, and is sweet
as a moonlit landscape, or a child’s dream of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, in reading these poems, an abiding sense
of the desolation that has fallen on the heart of the
writer, a desolation which only adds to the mournful
music of her lyre, like the approach of death, is fabled,
to give music to the swan. We have studiously
avoided, heretofore, touching upon this subject, as
we would not, by awakening pity, blind the judgment
of the public, but we cannot avoid the remark, that
every page of this volume bears evidence that the
heart of the authoress, like that of Rachel, will not
be comforted. The arrow has entered deep into her
soul. Like Mrs. Hemans, unfortunate in her domestic
life—for the miscreant who would still believe her
guilty is an insult to humanity—she “seeks, as the
stricken deer, to weep in silence and loneliness.”
Hers is a hard lot; deserted by the one who has
sworn to love her, and maligned by the unfeeling
world, she has not even the consolation of weeping
with her children, and finding some relief in their
caresses for her broken heart. Hear her once more—we
have almost wept as we read—hear her, when
gazing in the twilight at the pictures of her absent
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we must close this article. There are many
exquisite shorter pieces in the volume, besides
The Dream and Twilight. The Creole Girl; The
Child of Earth; I cannot Love Thee; The Visionary
Portrait; The Banner of the Covenanters; Weep
not for him that Dieth; and several of the Sonnets
may be instanced as among the finest. Let us, in
conclusion, commend the poems of Mrs. Norton to
our fair countrywomen as those of a mind of a high
order. Less egotism, a more extended scope of feeling,
and greater attention to the rules of her art, will
place her foremost among the female poets of England.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Bancroft’s History of the United Slates.” Vol. 3.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first two volumes of this history have now
been some years before the public, and criticism has
long since given them its <span class='it'>fiat</span>. The characteristics
of Mr. Bancroft are a rigid scrutiny of facts, a general
impartiality, and a style, usually nervous, but
sometimes savoring of transcendental obscurity. The
style of the second volume, however, is an improvement
on that of the first, and the volume before us
surpasses, in our opinion, either of the former two.
There is a philosophy in Bancroft which other historians
might well emulate. No man has traced so
clearly the causes of the American Revolution. It
was the stern, hard, independence of the Pilgrims,
handed down to their posterity, and united with the
gallant and chivalric freedom of the South, which
brought about the greatest revolution of modern
times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pictures which Mr. Bancroft draws in pursuing
the thread of his narrative, are often highly graphic.
The early adventures of Soto and others; the colony
of Raleigh at Roanoke; the landing of the Pilgrims;
the Indian wars of New England, are all described with
force if not with beauty. The gradual dissemination
of the Democratic principle is also faithfully depicted;
and it is clearly shown that the Puritans, the Swedes,
and the Quakers, alike formed pure democracies in
their settlements. In short, the history is something
more than a mere chronicle: it is a continuous essay
on the philosophy of the American Revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third volume brings the subject down to the
period of the old French war, an epoch which may be
considered at the threshold of the struggle for independence.
Here, for the present, he drops the curtain.
A fitter point, for such a pause could not have
been chosen. Behind, is the long succession of trials,
and dangers, through which the infant colonies had
just passed: before is the wild, shadowy future, soon
to become vivid with its startling panorama. Such a
reflection might well fill the mind of the historian
with a kind of solemn awe; and it is while such feelings
overpower his readers, that he introduces Washington,
the future hero of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work is beautifully printed, in a style highly
creditable to the American press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We leave Mr. Bancroft with the hope that his
historic labors will be pursued with redoubled zeal,
satisfied that in him America possesses a philosophic
annalist of the highest order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This work does credit to the editor, although he
has admitted some, and left out others, of our poetical
writers, whom we think he ought not so to have
treated. However, a compilation like this can never
be made to suit all. The true question is, who can
do better?</p>

of the hero (Lieut. Ormsby) are highly pleasing; and
he evinces a laudable desire to fall in love, as well
for his own as for the convenience of the reader. On
the whole, the book is well written, and quite
amusing.</p>
